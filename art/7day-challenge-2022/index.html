<a href="/~dustin/art">..</a><h1 id="7 Day Challenge 2022">7 Day Challenge 2022</h1><p>In October 2022 one of my favorite artists <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sdionbakerdesign/" target="_blank">Samantha Dion Baker</a> set up a 7-day challenge where each day you draw a specific time of a typical day for you. Posts for it can be seen on Instagram with the hashtag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/samanthaandohnmar7day/" target="_blank">#samanthaandohnmar7day</a>.</p><p>These were my drawings for this challenge. It's the only art challenge I've ever finished, and I'm proud of how these turned out!</p><h2 id="7 AM: Making breakfast for the kids">7 AM: Making breakfast for the kids</h2><p>I was shocked at how well my strawberries turned out. I'd never drawn one before and I was really proud of it.</p><a href="/~dustin/assets/img/01-7AM.jpg"><img src="/~dustin/assets/img/01-7AM.jpg"></a><h2 id="9 AM: Coffee">9 AM: Coffee</h2><p>I've drawn this mug many times as it was my favorite. Unfortunately it fell off a counter and broke after I drew this, and they no longer sell them since it was a limited edition mug from artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nathanielrussell" target="_blank">Nathaniel Russell</a>. It will be missed.</p><a href="/~dustin/assets/img/02-9AM.jpg"><img src="/~dustin/assets/img/02-9AM.jpg"></a><h2 id="12 PM: Breakfast">12 PM: Breakfast</h2><p>Since I was doing intermittent fasting, I usually wouldn't eat until about 12, which is why this was so late in my day. This is my least favorite of this set.</p><a href="/~dustin/assets/img/03-12PM.jpg"><img src="/~dustin/assets/img/03-12PM.jpg"></a><h2 id="2 PM: Working">2 PM: Working</h2><p>Since I was posting these on Instagram at the time, I started changing up how I took photos so they were angled and showing art supplies, which is the kind of things that get more likes.</p><a href="/~dustin/assets/img/04-2PM.jpg"><img src="/~dustin/assets/img/04-2PM.jpg"></a><h2 id="5 PM: Cooking dinner">5 PM: Cooking dinner</h2><p>This one almost doesn't look to me like something I did. It feels very different from my usual drawings, and I also like it a lot.</p><a href="/~dustin/assets/img/05-5PM.jpg"><img src="/~dustin/assets/img/05-5PM.jpg"></a><h2 id="7 PM: Cleaning">7 PM: Cleaning</h2><a href="/~dustin/assets/img/06-7PM.jpg"><img src="/~dustin/assets/img/06-7PM.jpg"></a><h2 id="10 PM: Reading">10 PM: Reading</h2><p>Of all the time texts at the top, this is my favorite. I really like the purple that I chose for it.</p><a href="/~dustin/assets/img/07-10PM.jpg"><img src="/~dustin/assets/img/07-10PM.jpg"></a>		</article>
