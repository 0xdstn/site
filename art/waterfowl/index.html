I quickly found 3 <strong>Canada Geese</strong>, a <strong>Mallard</strong> and 7 <strong>American Wigeons</strong>.</p><p>I took some photos and sat down to start sketching. Two of the geese were grazing in the grass while the other one kept watch. Eventually the two came within a foot of me. After a bit, the watcher came over and lowly hissed at me until I got nervous and left. It must have decided I was a threat.</p><p>The mallard was swimming in the group of wigeons. They didn't seem to mind.</p><p>It was nice getting out, seeing some birds, and sketching a bit. Watercolor takes a while to dry in the cold, so you have to wait a bit longer than you'd expect between coats of paint.</p>		</article>
