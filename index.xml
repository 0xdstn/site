I didn't know where to start, as I had exhausted all of the ideas I had from my initial investigation of the landscape. I poked around more in the repositories trying to find any sort of credentials I could use. There were some local SQL credentials, however port 3306 was not open on the server.</p><p>I had no idea how much more difficult this flag would be, and ended up going down the wrong path. I had decided there may be a documented vulnerability with the version of gogs they were running. I tried many different POCs for vulnerabilities related to gogs, all with no luck. I even tried using a script called <a href="https://github.com/TheZ3ro/gogsownz" target="_blank">gogsownz</a>. Nothing was working.</p><p>I was certain I was on the right track, because there was a reference to a file in the repo: <code>/tmp/testing/pwned777.txt</code>, I figured I needed to use a <strong>Path Traversal</strong> attack to find out what was in that file.</p><p>After a lot of effort I went into the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/TWr3Brs" target="_blank">Bugcrowd Discord</a> and asked how much more difficult the third flag was from the second. While looking in there I also noticed someone said there wasn't any vulnerable software, as far as they knew, so that would indicate that this was the wrong path to be going down.</p><p>There was then a hint posted</p><blockquote><strong>mqt:</strong> think of from where the API is pulling the data and what vulnerabilities can arise from this</blockquote><p>I was then thinking about how I saw those SQL credentials, and how graphql would use some sort of database technology. I then started researching how to do <strong>SQL Injection</strong> via <strong>graphql</strong> queries. It turned out that I could use the <strong>painting</strong> request where you pass an ID to get a single painting, and inject some SQL into it. This ended up working, and after some playing around I came up with this query:</p><pre>$ http http://164.90.156.83/graphql "Authorization:Bearer fae43547e79c6a5b6cf7ebc39f4d014d" "query=query IntrospectionQuery {painting(id:\"' UNION SELECT id, GROUP_CONCAT(password),GROUP_CONCAT(username),null,null FROM users #\"){id name artist}}"<br>HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br><br>{<br>    "data": {<br>        "painting": {<br>            "artist": "maxim,hadi,FLAG",<br>            "id": "1",<br>            "name": "29d79648ac14a5d8d0268867bd3161c6,bc8a5e6ccfb6c15b61d6d218c2df6cca,FLAG{2f55138f7dce2e3e852f1c8a487b33f9}"<br>        }<br>    }<br>}<br></pre><p>There it was, the third flag as a password of the user FLAG: <code>FLAG{2f55138f7dce2e3e852f1c8a487b33f9</code></p><h2 id="Takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p>This CTF provided multiple attack vectors that should be considered when writing software:</p><h3 id="Flag 1">Flag 1</h3><ul><li>Don't leave sensitive information in git repositories</li></ul><h3 id="Flag 2">Flag 2</h3><ul><li>Don't leave secrets or tokens in git repositories</li><li>Don't allow introspection queries in graphql</li></ul><h3 id="Flag 3">Flag 3</h3><ul><li>Sanitize your inputs to prevent SQL injection</li></ul><h2 id="Final notes">Final notes</h2><p>While I started going in the wrong direction, and I ended up using a hint, overall I consider this a success and I had a ton of fun participating.

I didn&#x27;t know where to start, as I had exhausted all of the ideas I had from my initial investigation of the landscape. I poked around more in the repositories trying to find any sort of credentials I could use. There were some local SQL credentials, however port 3306 was not open on the server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had no idea how much more difficult this flag would be, and ended up going down the wrong path. I had decided there may be a documented vulnerability with the version of gogs they were running. I tried many different POCs for vulnerabilities related to gogs, all with no luck. I even tried using a script called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TheZ3ro/gogsownz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gogsownz&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing was working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was certain I was on the right track, because there was a reference to a file in the repo: &lt;code&gt;/tmp/testing/pwned777.txt&lt;/code&gt;, I figured I needed to use a &lt;strong&gt;Path Traversal&lt;/strong&gt; attack to find out what was in that file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a lot of effort I went into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.com/invite/TWr3Brs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bugcrowd Discord&lt;/a&gt; and asked how much more difficult the third flag was from the second. While looking in there I also noticed someone said there wasn&#x27;t any vulnerable software, as far as they knew, so that would indicate that this was the wrong path to be going down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was then a hint posted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mqt:&lt;/strong&gt; think of from where the API is pulling the data and what vulnerabilities can arise from this&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was then thinking about how I saw those SQL credentials, and how graphql would use some sort of database technology. I then started researching how to do &lt;strong&gt;SQL Injection&lt;/strong&gt; via &lt;strong&gt;graphql&lt;/strong&gt; queries. It turned out that I could use the &lt;strong&gt;painting&lt;/strong&gt; request where you pass an ID to get a single painting, and inject some SQL into it. This ended up working, and after some playing around I came up with this query:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ http http://164.90.156.83/graphql &quot;Authorization:Bearer fae43547e79c6a5b6cf7ebc39f4d014d&quot; &quot;query=query IntrospectionQuery {painting(id:\&quot;&#x27; UNION SELECT id, GROUP_CONCAT(password),GROUP_CONCAT(username),null,null FROM users #\&quot;){id name artist}}&quot;&lt;br&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{&lt;br&gt;    &quot;data&quot;: {&lt;br&gt;        &quot;painting&quot;: {&lt;br&gt;            &quot;artist&quot;: &quot;maxim,hadi,FLAG&quot;,&lt;br&gt;            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,&lt;br&gt;            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;29d79648ac14a5d8d0268867bd3161c6,bc8a5e6ccfb6c15b61d6d218c2df6cca,FLAG{2f55138f7dce2e3e852f1c8a487b33f9}&quot;&lt;br&gt;        }&lt;br&gt;    }&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;There it was, the third flag as a password of the user FLAG: &lt;code&gt;FLAG{2f55138f7dce2e3e852f1c8a487b33f9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;Takeaways&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This CTF provided multiple attack vectors that should be considered when writing software:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;Flag 1&quot;&gt;Flag 1&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don&#x27;t leave sensitive information in git repositories&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;Flag 2&quot;&gt;Flag 2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don&#x27;t leave secrets or tokens in git repositories&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don&#x27;t allow introspection queries in graphql&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;Flag 3&quot;&gt;Flag 3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sanitize your inputs to prevent SQL injection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;Final notes&quot;&gt;Final notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I started going in the wrong direction, and I ended up using a hint, overall I consider this a success and I had a ton of fun participating. I&#x27;m going to continue to try my hand at other challenges. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <description><![CDATA[<h1><span class="emoji">&#128221;</span> 2020 Review</h1><p><em>2020.12.31</em></p><p>As we all know, this has been a crazy year. I figured I'd write down some reflections on it as we move into 2021.</p><ol><li><a href="#Challenges">Challenges</a></li><li><a href="#Personal growth">Personal growth</a></li><li><a href="#Gratitude">Gratitude</a></li><li><a href="#Changes">Changes</a></li><li><a href="#Reading">Reading</a></li><li><a href="#2021">2021</a></li></ol><h2 id="Challenges">Challenges</h2><p>Aside from the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, I faced additional challenges that I was not prepared for. In January, we ended up unexpectedly taking in two more children, bringing our total up to four. It was intended to be a temporary thing, 90 days max. They are still with us today, with no real end in sight.</p><p>Learning to parent children you didn't bring into this world, coming in with their own issues and traumas is challenging. This has tested me as a parent like nothing else. I never realized how much more difficult it could be.</p><p>On top of that, we all ended up doing school and work at home for a long time. I'm still working from home since March, and in-person schooling just started back up. You really grow together and simultaneously clash in an environment like this. It takes some getting used to, but it lends itself to much personal growth.</p><h2 id="Personal growth">Personal growth</h2><p>Due to the unique challenges I've faced this year, I feel I have made a ton of personal growth. I was forced into situations that made it necessary to look inward, and learn.</p><p>Since summer, I have been doing therapy, which I avoided for years, always using some excuse. This was one of the best decisions I have ever made. It has really allowed me to learn about myself, work on myself, and be more self aware.</p><p>Through all of this, I have become closer to my wife than we have ever been, and I feel like I'm learning to be a better parent (though I have a lot more to learn).</p><p>Even with all of the difficulties, I feel happier with myself than I've felt in a long time.</p><h2 id="Gratitude">Gratitude</h2><p>It may be odd, but I am grateful for the pandemic. It pushed me to be a better version of myself. I had no choice but to grow, or it would have been incredibly more difficult.</p><p>I am also very grateful that it did not impact my job, as it has for so many. I can continue working from home, and I don't have to worry about our financial state.</p><p>I'm grateful for my wife for pushing me to seek help in the form of therapy. Without her encouragement, I wouldn't be who I am today. Who I am today is not who I was at the beginning of the year.</p><h2 id="Changes">Changes</h2><p>I made some changes in my life this year, primarily rules I put on myself, allowing me to be less stressed and overall better.</p><ul><li>Self imposed <strong>digital minimalism</strong> restrictions</li><li>Utilizing the <strong>Love and Logic</strong> parenting style</li><li>Learned a lot of about <strong>diversity and inclusion</strong>, and becoming aware of my own privilege</li><li>Started <strong>self reflecting</strong> in my bullet journal</li></ul><h2 id="Reading">Reading</h2><p>I set out with a goal of reading 15 books this year, and I ended up reading 38. That was highly unexpected for myself.</p><p>Even if you don't include the comics or very short books, I still surpassed my goal. I'm proud of myself for this, as I never used to be much of a reader prior to 2019.</p><p>My goal for next year is going to be 20 books, as I'll probably read more normal length books.</p><p>I want to primarily focus on nature and philosophy books, with a few fiction books here and there.</p><p>While I've set this goal, I'm also going to try to not obsess over the number, as I've done that before. If I don't hit it, or I surpass it, what really matters is what I get out of the books.</p><p>My favorite books this year were:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC1JAI" target="_blank">Meditations</a> by Marcus Aurelius, Gregory Hays</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBRBP7G" target="_blank">Digital Minimalism</a> by Cal Newport</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IV351R0" target="_blank">Parenting With Love and Logic</a> by Foster Cline, Jim Fay</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MPYX96Y" target="_blank">Better Allies</a> by Karen Catlin</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DFHBWKV" target="_blank">No Longer Human</a> by Osamu Dazai</li><li><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/520" target="_blank">The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus</a> by L. Frank Baum</li></ul><h2 id="2021">2021</h2><p>Moving into <strong>2021</strong> I'd like to work on the following:</p><ul><li>Create a solid <strong>morning routine</strong></li><li>Start and stick to a <strong>daily meditation</strong> habit</li><li><strong>Write/reflect</strong> nearly every day</li><li>Be <strong>less strict</strong> with myself and others</li><li>Take the time to <strong>paint/sketch</strong> more</li><li>Use my <strong>phone</strong> for <strong>less than an hour a day</strong></li></ul>]]></description>

In January, we ended up unexpectedly taking in two more children, bringing our total up to four. It was intended to be a temporary thing, 90 days max. They are still with us today, with no real end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning to parent children you didn&#x27;t bring into this world, coming in with their own issues and traumas is challenging. This has tested me as a parent like nothing else. I never realized how much more difficult it could be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, we all ended up doing school and work at home for a long time. I&#x27;m still working from home since March, and in-person schooling just started back up. You really grow together and simultaneously clash in an environment like this. It takes some getting used to, but it lends itself to much personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;Personal growth&quot;&gt;Personal growth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the unique challenges I&#x27;ve faced this year, I feel I have made a ton of personal growth. I was forced into situations that made it necessary to look inward, and learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since summer, I have been doing therapy, which I avoided for years, always using some excuse. This was one of the best decisions I have ever made. It has really allowed me to learn about myself, work on myself, and be more self aware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through all of this, I have become closer to my wife than we have ever been, and I feel like I&#x27;m learning to be a better parent (though I have a lot more to learn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with all of the difficulties, I feel happier with myself than I&#x27;ve felt in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;Gratitude&quot;&gt;Gratitude&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be odd, but I am grateful for the pandemic. It pushed me to be a better version of myself. I had no choice but to grow, or it would have been incredibly more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am also very grateful that it did not impact my job, as it has for so many. I can continue working from home, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about our financial state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m grateful for my wife for pushing me to seek help in the form of therapy. Without her encouragement, I wouldn&#x27;t be who I am today. Who I am today is not who I was at the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;Changes&quot;&gt;Changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made some changes in my life this year, primarily rules I put on myself, allowing me to be less stressed and overall better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Self imposed &lt;strong&gt;digital minimalism&lt;/strong&gt; restrictions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Utilizing the &lt;strong&gt;Love and Logic&lt;/strong&gt; parenting style&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learned a lot of about &lt;strong&gt;diversity and inclusion&lt;/strong&gt;, and becoming aware of my own privilege&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Started &lt;strong&gt;self reflecting&lt;/strong&gt; in my bullet journal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;Reading&quot;&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set out with a goal of reading 15 books this year, and I ended up reading 38. That was highly unexpected for myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t include the comics or very short books, I still surpassed my goal. I&#x27;m proud of myself for this, as I never used to be much of a reader prior to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My goal for next year is going to be 20 books, as I&#x27;ll probably read more normal length books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to primarily focus on nature and philosophy books, with a few fiction books here and there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I&#x27;ve set this goal, I&#x27;m also going to try to not obsess over the number, as I&#x27;ve done that before. If I don&#x27;t hit it, or I surpass it, what really matters is what I get out of the books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite books this year were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC1JAI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meditations&lt;/a&gt; by Marcus Aurelius, Gregory Hays&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBRBP7G&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digital Minimalism&lt;/a&gt; by Cal Newport&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IV351R0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parenting With Love and Logic&lt;/a&gt; by Foster Cline, Jim Fay&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MPYX96Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Better Allies&lt;/a&gt; by Karen Catlin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DFHBWKV&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;No Longer Human&lt;/a&gt; by Osamu Dazai&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/520&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&lt;/a&gt; by L. Frank Baum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;2021&quot;&gt;2021&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving into &lt;strong&gt;2021&lt;/strong&gt; I&#x27;d like to work on the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a solid &lt;strong&gt;morning routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start and stick to a &lt;strong&gt;daily meditation&lt;/strong&gt; habit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write/reflect&lt;/strong&gt; nearly every day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be &lt;strong&gt;less strict&lt;/strong&gt; with myself and others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take the time to &lt;strong&gt;paint/sketch&lt;/strong&gt; more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use my &lt;strong&gt;phone&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;less than an hour a day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded>

Jobs, relationships, thoughts, feelings, loved ones, ourselves, everything we know and perceive will pass out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know this, but we cling to things and perceive them as permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two types of impermanence - gross and subtle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Matter decays, empires rise and fall, societal norms change and evolve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Moment-to-moment, cells in your body die and regenerate, you are never exactly the same. We are collections of impermanent, momentary experiences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss is a natural part of life, not something we need to fight against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;Non-self&quot;&gt;Non-self&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are not what you think you are, because there is no inherent essence in anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things are because of, and in relation to, other things, but do not exist on their own as permanent or separate entities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything has causes and conditions, nothing stands alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no permanent or fixed you, just a complex web of inseparable, impermanent, causes and effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;The Three Poisons&quot;&gt;The Three Poisons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hatred&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ignorance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</content:encoded>

If I'm reading posts about things people are doing, I will become obsessed with whatever topic that is for a while, until something new shifts my focus. This means that every day I could be getting pulled in a new direction, which is time consuming and exhausting.</p><p>Because of all of my failed attempts at using Mastodon and other social media, I'm now shying away from it all. I've deleted my Mastodon account and will not make another one (I've had a lot of accounts on various instances over the years).</p><p>My choice now is to organically find things that pique my interest. This is a lot more manageable and less likely to cause me to switch what I'm doing constantly.</p><p>I will be writing my thoughts and documenting my projects on this site, and that will be it. If someone wants to contact me, they can use my <a href="mailto:0xdstn@protonmail.com">email</a>. There is no other way to send me a message. I imagine this will cause me to get nearly nobody reaching out to me, and that's okay. If someone finds it worth their time to click my email link and write something to me, that means to me that they really care about that communication. It will be a nice gesture if it happens, and it will not be missed if it does not.</p><p>I am also choosing to follow some people who's work I like and want to keep up on via an RSS reader.

        <description><![CDATA[<h1><span class="emoji">&#128221;</span> Focus</h1><p><em>2021.07.28</em></p><p>My mind is scattered. I shift between what I want to focus on on a monthly, sometimes even weekly, basis. It's a problem that I struggle with and it is not ideal.</p><p>I can pretty much forecast how my focus will shift at this point. At the very leas, every few months, and definitely just before Defcon each year, I get interested in doing bug bounties (<a href="https://bugcrowd.com" target="_blank">BugCrowd</a>, <a href="https://hackerone.com" target="_blank">HackerOne</a>). I will get interested in security and appsec, and let it the obsession take over my responsibilities and life.</p><p>There is usually a desire for the large bug payouts and the fame that can come with this. I find the hacker culture, in general, very enticing.</p><p>I don't actually have enough skills to properly bug hunt, yet I never make time to study and practice. Because of this, I just spin my wheels (usually while neglecting my job or my family), then come out of it in an exhausted daze. There is a specific way I feel after trying to make something work over and over only to not succeed, and I don't like it. That is what bug hunting would always be like, even if I got good enough to do it properly.</p><p>I realized yesterday (after doing this) that something I like about bug hunting, aside from the possibility of getting paid or recognition, is that it's basically a puzzle to solve. The problem is, most of the time there is no way to solve the puzzle. Often there are no bugs where you are searching. That can be very frustrating.</p><p>Whenever I think about why I am interested in doing this, these are usually my reasons:</p><ul><li>Hacking is fun/interesting</li><li>Potential to make a lot of money</li><li>Potential to reach a certain level of fame</li></ul><p>The problem with these reasons, is I don't <em>need</em> the money because I have a decent paying job, and I definitely don't need the fame. This reminds me of Marcus Aurelius' view of fame - we will all be dead and forgotten soon, so why strive for fame?</p><p>That leaves the fact that I find hacking fun/interesting. I think the challenge/puzzle of it is what I really enjoy, which leads me to believe that I would feel just as happy working on a challenging puzzle (like the <a href="https://hackmd.io/@tux0/goldbug2020" target="_blank">Gold Bug puzzle</a> from the <a href="https://cryptovillage.org" target="_blank">Crypto &amp; Privacy village</a> at Defcon). It has a solution, so I wouldn't feel I was just spinning my wheels, and at the same time it has nothing to do with money or fame - it's just something I want to do because I enjoy it.</p><p>Another thought I had on this was giving myself a question to answer - <strong>Would I want to do this if I were retired?</strong> The answer to that is no. If I was retired and didn't have to worry about money or really computers at all anymore, I would not be interested in this. I would be spending time with my family, painting, and reading. That answer tells me exactly where I should direct my focus.</p><p><strong>A note to my future self if I go down this rabbit hole again:</strong></p><p>It isn't worth it. There are not enough benefits to outweigh how it makes you feel, and it isn't where your priorities should lie. If you must do something, find a puzzle/challenge with a real solution and solve that. Even write up how you got there if you want to share it with others.</p><p>You should focus on the things that matter:</p><ul><li>Family</li><li>Painting</li><li>Reading</li></ul><p>Don't do this to yourself again.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<h1><span class="emoji">&#128221;</span> Digital Minimalism</h1><p><em>2022.02.25</em></p><p>I've listed my <a href="/wiki/philosophy#Technology">personal philosophy on technology</a> already, but I decided I'd like to write a post specifically on digital minimalism.</p><p>In 2020 I read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBRBP7G" target="_blank">Digital Minimalism</a> by Cal Newport. That book defined a lot of my current views on technology, which is almost the complete opposite of my previous relationship with technology. I should note that while I hold these specific views, sticking to them is not easy. I get easily distracted and addicted to technology, as a lot of us do, and that is what I'm trying to stay away from.</p><p>The biggest takeaway from that book is that I want to be <em>intentional</em> with my use of technology. I tend to get sucked in to a whirlwind of digital activities, and I am working to put boundaries in place, both mental and digital, to prevent those kinds of behaviors.</p><h2 id="Digital limitations">Digital limitations</h2><p>One thing I have done is uninstalled specific applications and even blocked certain sites on my phone. I don't want to use my phone to escape, or really even for entertainment. I view my phone as a tool. It's for playing music, viewing my calendar, setting alarms, getting directions, ordering coffee, etc. I want my phone to be a purely utilitarian device.</p><p>I have decided to leave certain social apps on my phone, as they are challenging to use on other devices, but I don't allow myself to open them when I'm bored. I need to have a purpose going into them (like posting something).</p><p>I have also blocked my Mastodon instances in firefox on mobile using <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/" target="_blank">LeechBlock NG</a>. Those are not sites I want to just visit when I'm bored. I want to go into them intending to spend some time browsing them and/or posting something. These are activities I can do intentionally on my laptop.</p><h2 id="Mental limitations">Mental limitations</h2><p>Digital limitations can only do so much. There also needs to be mental limitations in place. This can be challenging to keep up, but having rules in place for yourself is helpful in keeping focused.</p><p>One time suck that I struggle with is the explore tab on Instagram. It's really good at showing curated posts that align with your interests, and I need to stay away from that, as I tend to just sit there and scroll for a very long time. My mental rule for this is simple: I'm never allowed to open the explore tab. Ever. For any reason. This habit can be difficult to break, but it prevents me from doing something mentally destructive that gives me nothing in return.</p><p>Another thing I have been doing is not allowing myself to do distracting things on my work computer. I struggle with focusing on work, and can easily get caught up in something for hours and realize I've done nothing productive that day. Distracting activities either need to never be done, or done intentionally on my personal computer after work hours.</p><h2 id="Accepting technology">Accepting technology</h2><p>Another mindset I got from the book is to not accept technology as it is. You need to assess a piece of technology and determine if it aligns with your personal goals. If it is useful, but it has all these other distracting features, can you turn those off? Can you make a rule for yourself to never use them? Can you find an alternative that is more dialed in to what you're trying to achieve? Can you build an alternative yourself?</p><p>It's fortunate that I'm a software engineer, so I can write my own programs if needed. I've made many different things for myself that fit specific needs, as opposed to just using something off the shelf that is <em>close enough</em>.</p><h2 id="Final thoughts">Final thoughts</h2><p>Overall the intent here is to do the following:</p><ul><li>Use technology intentionally</li><li>Build up digital and mental limitations to support your goals</li><li>Don't accept things as they are, make technology work for you, not against you</li></ul>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<h1><span class="emoji">&#128221;</span> On writing</h1><p><em>2022.07.13</em></p><p>I would like to be a writer. Not necessarily a published writer, but just a writer.

My solution to this is to take a bite, then set down my fork until it's gone and I'm ready to take another bite. Doing this allows me to fully experience and enjoy the food, be aware of how full I am, and be more present in the moment, as opposed to passively eating.

I don't want to spend the time thinking about other things. Instead I choose to focus on the flavors, textures, and smells of the food. I also take some of the time thinking about being grateful for the food and where it came from. I think about where it came from or the person that prepared it.

Here are my favorite online stations/sites:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://radio.garden/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Radio Garden&lt;/a&gt; I use this to listen to radio stations from Japan or Hawaii&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jetsetradio.live/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jet Set Radio LIVE&lt;/a&gt; The JSR soundtrack + other similar music&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jetsetradiofuture.live/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jet Set Radio Future LIVE&lt;/a&gt;, The JSRF soundtrack + other similar music&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tilderadio.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tilderadio&lt;/a&gt; A tildeverse radio station with various volunteer DJs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://somafm.com/player/#/now-playing/defcon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DEF CON Radio&lt;/a&gt; The SomaFM station for DEF CON&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lofi.cafe/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lofi.cafe&lt;/a&gt; Various lofi stations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mindmelt.party/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MINDMELT&lt;/a&gt; Music visualizer with various electronic music stations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded>

        <description><![CDATA[<h1><span class="emoji">&#128221;</span> On Art</h1><p><em>2023.05.04</em></p><p>I have been thinking a lot about art and how it plays a role in my life, or more so how I <em>want</em> it to play a role.</p><h2 id="Voice">Voice</h2><blockquote>"Your voice is formed over time through continuous experimentation and intentional practice" - Lisa Congdon</blockquote><blockquote>"Your voice develops as a by-product of doing the stuff you enjoy over and over again and making discoveries" - Lisa Congdon</blockquote><p>Some things I've struggled with is finding my artistic voice/what kind of work I make. I've done all sorts of things like sketch journaling, nature journaling, urban sketching, character drawings, typography, etc. None of it feels like me, it just feels like I'm trying to emulate all the artists who's work I like. I feel as though I'm trying a lot of things and becoming good at none of them because of it.</p><p>I've been reading through <strong>Find Your Artistic Voice</strong> by <em>Lisa Congdon</em>. I'm not done yet but I'm gathering some good advice from it:</p><ul><li>Trying a bunch of things is how you discover your voice.

I&#x27;ve done all sorts of things like sketch journaling, nature journaling, urban sketching, character drawings, typography, etc. None of it feels like me, it just feels like I&#x27;m trying to emulate all the artists who&#x27;s work I like. I feel as though I&#x27;m trying a lot of things and becoming good at none of them because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been reading through &lt;strong&gt;Find Your Artistic Voice&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Lisa Congdon&lt;/em&gt;. I&#x27;m not done yet but I&#x27;m gathering some good advice from it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trying a bunch of things is how you discover your voice. Most of it will be terrible, and that&#x27;s okay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on the things you like to do, results will emerge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The more drawings you make, the less you care about each one, and you&#x27;ll end up taking more chances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Make a lot of junk, sort through the junk, pull out the pieces that feel like you - the work that makes you smile, makes you proud, and gets your creative juices flowing to make more.

There was even some beautiful fog with a (nearly) full moon last night!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m sitting here in my kitchen with a nice cup of coffee, cool air blowing in from an open window, writing this, and all feels great.  &lt;span class=&quot;emoji&quot;&gt;&amp;#128153;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m trying to slow down. This is something I&#x27;ve tried many times, but I always just end up doing too much again, burning out, and feeling stressed all the time. I want a more relaxed, intentional, and slow paced kind of life. Maybe writing things down here will help with that? I guess we&#x27;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post 001/100 of &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/100-days-to-offload&quot;&gt;#100DaysToOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <description><![CDATA[<h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Podcasts + Veilid</h1><p><em>2023.09.11</em></p><h2 id="&#127911; Podcasts"> <span class="emoji">&#127911;</span> Podcasts</h2><p>Over this last week I finished two podcasts:</p><h3 id="The Polybius Conspiracy">The Polybius Conspiracy</h3><p>I was surprised that I had never heard of the game Polybius, until recently. It has all the things that I tend to navigate toward: an urban legend, 80s video games, and being from the PNW (Portland, OR). I found the ending a little disappointing, but I would still recommend this podcast.</p><p>Apparently the originally planned to do a documentary via Kickstarter, but it was not fully funded, so they pivoted to this podcast. It's a mix of investigation into the myth, and a fictional storyline attached to the research. I would have enjoyed an actual documentary, but this was still really informative as far as what people believe about this myth.</p><h3 id="Blackwood">Blackwood</h3><p>This one is only 6 episodes, and I finished it in a single day. I liked the story and the characters. It's about a group of teenagers looking in to the myth of the Bugman, and they find there is a lot more to this than a simple myth.  It ends not necessarily on a cliffhanger, but on a promise for a second season to get more answers.

        <content:encoded>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;emoji&quot;&gt;&amp;#128173;&lt;/span&gt; Podcasts + Veilid&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2023.09.11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;&amp;#127911; Podcasts&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emoji&quot;&gt;&amp;#127911;&lt;/span&gt; Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over this last week I finished two podcasts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;The Polybius Conspiracy&quot;&gt;The Polybius Conspiracy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that I had never heard of the game Polybius, until recently. It has all the things that I tend to navigate toward: an urban legend, 80s video games, and being from the PNW (Portland, OR). I found the ending a little disappointing, but I would still recommend this podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently the originally planned to do a documentary via Kickstarter, but it was not fully funded, so they pivoted to this podcast. It&#x27;s a mix of investigation into the myth, and a fictional storyline attached to the research. I would have enjoyed an actual documentary, but this was still really informative as far as what people believe about this myth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;Blackwood&quot;&gt;Blackwood&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is only 6 episodes, and I finished it in a single day. I liked the story and the characters. It&#x27;s about a group of teenagers looking in to the myth of the Bugman, and they find there is a lot more to this than a simple myth.  It ends not necessarily on a cliffhanger, but on a promise for a second season to get more answers. I would have loved a second season, but it seems the company went under and that will not be happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think if you go in knowing that a second season won&#x27;t happen, it&#x27;ll be less dissapointing at the end, but I still think this was a good story and would recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;&amp;#128187; Veilid&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emoji&quot;&gt;&amp;#128187;&lt;/span&gt; Veilid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since they were teasing it before Defcon, I&#x27;ve been curious about &lt;a href=&quot;https://veilid.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Veilid&lt;/a&gt;, a new framework from Cult of the Dead Cow.

        <description><![CDATA[<h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Podcast Recommendations</h1><p><em>2023.09.13</em></p><p>I was asked by <a href="https://82mhz.net/" target="_blank">82mhz</a> for fiction podcast recommendations, and I ended up sending a lengthy email, which I figured might be useful to some other people so I decided to publish it here. Below are a couple categories with my favorite podcasts of each.</p><h2 id="&#128123; Paranormal"> <span class="emoji">&#128123;</span> Paranormal</h2><p>I got started in audio dramas with <a href="https://theblacktapespodcast.com/" target="_blank">The Black Tapes</a>. It's about ghosts and investigating them, but one of the main characters does not believe in ghosts. It has concluded (no news seasons will be created), and it was one of my favorites.</p><p>I am currently listening to <a href="https://www.archive81.com/" target="_blank">Archive 81</a> and I love it. It's one of my top favorites of all time. The first season was fantastic. It's about a building where a lot of weird stuff happens. The second season takes a huge turn into a very different and bizarre storyline, but I was on board. I'm currently listening to season 3, and it's fantastic. It can be a bit graphic, and it's definitely extremely weird, but if you're into that kind of stuff it's great. They also turned the first season into a show on Netflix, which was cancelled after the first season. I'm maybe halfway through that, but it's also pretty good. This podcast is also complete, so no new seasons will be created.</p><p>Every year the <a href="https://www.grimandmild.com/13days" target="_blank">13 Days of Halloween</a> podcast has an episode a day in the 13 days leading up to Halloween. Each season is a self contained story, and I have loved it every year. This is from the creator of the podcast Lore, if you've ever heard of that.</p><p>He also created <a href="https://www.grimandmild.com/12ghosts" target="_blank">12 Ghosts</a>, which is the same format as 13 days, but it's the 12 days leading up to Christmas. It's also fantastic and I would highly recommend both.</p><p>I recently finished <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/video-palace/id1439247558" target="_blank">Video Palace</a>. It was created by the horror streaming service, Shudder. I really enjoyed this one. It's about some mysterious VHS tapes that cause weird things for the people that watch them. I believe it was canceled, but I can't remember. There was also <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Video-Palace-In-Search-of-the-Eyeless-Man/Maynard-Wills/9781982156497" target="_blank">book</a> that spun off from it that I bought but haven't read yet.</p><p><a href="https://qcodemedia.com/theleftrightgame" target="_blank">The Left Right Game</a> was based on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7asz8x/has_anyone_heard_of_the_leftright_game_part_1/" target="_blank">creepy pasta</a>. It was really good and very bizarre. It's about a game you play where you drive and as soon as you can, turn left, then the next turn right. You can't miss a turn or bad things happen, and during the drive a lot of weird things happen. Pretty interesting idea.</p><h2 id="&#128125; Scifi"> <span class="emoji">&#128125;</span> Scifi</h2><p>One of my top favorite podcasts is <a href="https://www.rabbitspodcast.com/" target="_blank">Rabbits</a>. It's about a mysterious game with alternate reality/multiverse themes. This was created by the same person that made The Black Tapes. It also spun off a <a href="https://www.rabbitspodcast.com/thenovel" target="_blank">book</a> which I really enjoyed,and a sequel, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/690757/the-quiet-room-by-terry-miles/" target="_blank">The Quiet Room</a>, that hasn't been released yet. This one is still ongoing, so a new season will come eventually.</p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p090t9cl" target="_blank">The Cipher</a> is from the BBC and it's about weird puzzles, extra terrestrial themes, etc. I think they will have a second season eventually but one isn't out yet. The first was released in 2021.</p><h2 id="&#127916; Thrillers"> <span class="emoji">&#127916;</span> Thrillers</h2><p>I don't know what to categorize these as. They aren't scifi or paranormal. They're just.. things that could happen in our real world. Thriller seemed the best description I could come up with.</p><p><a href="https://qcodemedia.com/blackout" target="_blank">Blackout</a> has 2 seasons. It follows a family as they deal with all of the power suddenly going out in the US and not coming back.</p><p><a href="https://www.tenable.com/podcast/hacker-chronicles" target="_blank">The Hacker Chronicles</a> is about someone who stumbles into cyber crime and we go along with her as she learns, makes mistakes, and deals with the aftermath of her hacks. It's currently in the second season, and not all episodes of it are out yet. I'm a couple episodes behind but it's been really good so far.</p><h2 id="&#127911; Misc"> <span class="emoji">&#127911;</span> Misc</h2><p>I recently finished <a href="https://radiotopiapresents.fm/the-polybius-conspiracy" target="_blank">The Polybius Conspiracy</a>. It's a weird mix of a fiction story and presenting information about the myth of Polybius (a mysterious black arcade game that supposedly appeared for a bit in Portland, OR in the 80s and caused adverse effects in the people who played it). I found the ending fairly disappointing, but it was still interesting to listen to. There won't be more seasons.</p><p>Every year the <a href="https://www.ruritania.co.uk/stories" target="_blank">Christmas Stories</a> podcast has 24 new episodes in the days leading up to Christmas, but unlike 12 Ghosts, this one is a light, enjoyable story. Each year is a single story split across the 24 episodes. This one feels closest to the old radio dramas. I listened to it the last 2 years and really enjoyed each of the stories.</p><p><strong>Post 006/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p>]]></description>

The play/pause button doesn't work most of the time. It is used for two things: Playing/pausing the music, and shutting down the iPod by holding it down. I've found workarounds for these:</p><ul><li>I enabled the <strong>Settings > Playback Settings > Pause on Headphone Unplug</strong> setting, configuring it to <strong>Pause and Resume</strong>, which means that when I unplug my headphones, it pauses, and when I plug them back in it plays.

I would have described myself as a workaholic.</p><p>I no longer have that drive, and I struggle to care about work most days. It's not that I don't enjoy doing the kind of work I do. I still enjoy coding, even for a company, but I just cannot focus like I used to.</p><p>I constantly find myself sitting there, a million things to do, and I just want to draw. Sometimes I do when I'm working from home. I just draw things and ignore my responsibilities. I feel like I am constantly drawn to making art, and no matter how often I dedicate time or take time for it, I still want to make more.</p><p>This almost feels like my own mind telling me "Hey, this isn't fun anymore, this other thing is, why aren't we doing that?". But it's not that simple. I can't simply quit being a software engineer and pursue art. When I think of that, I have a lot of reasons or excuses:</p><ul><li>I have a family, we need the money</li><li>I am not good enough of an artist to make money doing it</li><li>What if I hate making art when it becomes my job?</li><li>I haven't found my artistic voice, nothing I do is cohesive</li></ul><p>So what do I do with this?</p><p>I don't know that I ever want to quit my software engineering job to become a full time artist. It feels like that just isn't possible. That being said, if I somehow get to the point where that is a viable option, I would probably take it. That itself is an indicator to me that I should be putting in the effort to get there. I can't ever make it happen if I don't try. All that could happen is it doesn't work, and I continue doing what I'm doing, continue making art for the sake of making art, and everything is fine. I should just try.</p><p>I <a href="/writing/on-art">previously wrote</a> about how I don't want to use Instagram, don't want to build a following, and I just want to make art for the sake of making art. This goes entirely against that view, but I'm constantly being drawn to it, and not finding drawing things and leaving them in my sketchbook for nobody to see fulfilling. I don't necessarily need the "likes", but posting it somewhere like IG tends to motivate me to dedicate more time to art, and it could eventually become something more if I keep at it. Or it won't, who knows. I can't know until I do it and see what happens.</p><p>I have been listening to <a href="https://www.sneakyartist.com/podcast" target="_blank">The SneakyArt Podcast</a>, and listening to others talk about building up their community, challenging themselves with art, and just making things and enjoying the process really speaks to me. Seeing my favorite accounts on Instagram share things without fear of failure is inspiring. I could do this. I want to do this.</p><p>I also realized something while listening to <a href="https://www.sneakyartist.com/blog/ep12" target="_blank">Episode 12</a> with <a href="https://www.drawnontheway.com/about-sarah" target="_blank">Sarah Nisbett</a>. She was talking about how inspiring others to create art gives her a feeling of "I've done it. That's all I needed to succeed". I hadn't considered this, but if I was inspiring others to dive into an art practice, I'd also feel very happy and like I've done something worthwhile in sharing my art online. That also lead me to thinking about how I would probably enjoy teaching others to make art. When I say or think that, I immediately dive into the feeling that I am not good enough to be qualified for that, but I also find it very appealing and would probably love it if I could do that.</p><p>If I go into this with these goals, I feel like I'll be a lot more successful than previous attempts where my goals were to build a following and sell art:</p><ul><li>Become more motivated to create and share art</li><li>Build a daily art practice and find my artistic voice along the way</li><li>Inspire others to create art</li><li>Start teaching others to create art</li></ul><p>To achieve this, I would first simply start drawing as often as I can, and share as much as I can, to organically build a following. As an outcome of this, I should find my artistic voice, and hopefully start inspiring others to create art. Once I have cemented a practice and a following, I can explore what it looks like to teach others. Whether that is creating online classes (Skillshare, Domestika, A custom built site) and/or teaching local in-person classes. That still feels terrifying, and I feel wildly unqualified, but if I can build my confidence, this could become a possibility.</p><p>The only unfortunate piece of this, is pretty much the only way to build a following from nothing in the art world is to use Instagram, which means playing by their algorithmic rules.

I know that probably nobody is looking at me or caring about what I'm doing, and from what I've heard when people are, they're usually pretty friendly if not excited about what you're drawing, but it's really difficult to push past that feeling.

        <description><![CDATA[<h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Excessive Tech</h1><p><em>2023.11.27</em></p><p>I recently switched to my own self-hosted <a href="/wiki/nextcloud">Nextcloud</a> instance. I thought a lot about it lately, and have decided to shut it down and seek solutions elsewhere.</p><p>I had set up <a href="/thoughts/nextcloud-music">Nextcloud Music</a> since my <a href="/wiki/ipod/">iPod</a> seems to be having issues (probably the HDD, which I'd like to replace someday so I can use it again). This was fine, but I just didn't feel I was getting the same experience I was getting from the iPod, which I wrote about in my piece <a href="/writing/on-music">On Music</a>. I decided to not use NextCloud for music, but that made me consider something else: do I need such a large and off the shelf solution to solve my problems?</p><p>The answer, as it turns out, is no. I <a href="/writing/digital-minimalism/#Accepting%20technology">decided long ago</a> that I would build solutions for myself if pre-built apps are excessive and/or distracting. NextCloud is great, but it's just so much when my needs are minimal. What I need is this:</p><ul><li>A way to transfer files between devices, usually not many</li><li>A place to store and edit notes</li><li>A way to listen to my music library</li></ul><p>NextCloud seems a bit of an overkill for such simple needs. I've decided to try the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Files:</strong> Using a USB stick to transfer files between devices.

        <content:encoded>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;emoji&quot;&gt;&amp;#128173;&lt;/span&gt; Excessive Tech&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2023.11.27&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently switched to my own self-hosted &lt;a href=&quot;/wiki/nextcloud&quot;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt; instance. I thought a lot about it lately, and have decided to shut it down and seek solutions elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had set up &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/nextcloud-music&quot;&gt;Nextcloud Music&lt;/a&gt; since my &lt;a href=&quot;/wiki/ipod/&quot;&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; seems to be having issues (probably the HDD, which I&#x27;d like to replace someday so I can use it again). This was fine, but I just didn&#x27;t feel I was getting the same experience I was getting from the iPod, which I wrote about in my piece &lt;a href=&quot;/writing/on-music&quot;&gt;On Music&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to not use NextCloud for music, but that made me consider something else: do I need such a large and off the shelf solution to solve my problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, as it turns out, is no. I &lt;a href=&quot;/writing/digital-minimalism/#Accepting%20technology&quot;&gt;decided long ago&lt;/a&gt; that I would build solutions for myself if pre-built apps are excessive and/or distracting. NextCloud is great, but it&#x27;s just so much when my needs are minimal. What I need is this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A way to transfer files between devices, usually not many&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A place to store and edit notes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A way to listen to my music library&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NextCloud seems a bit of an overkill for such simple needs. I&#x27;ve decided to try the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Files:&lt;/strong&gt; Using a USB stick to transfer files between devices. I even have a USB-C to USB dongle that I can use to plug it in to my phone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt; Editing local notes on my phone using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gsantner/markor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Markor&lt;/a&gt;, then syncing it to my USB drive each week in case my phone fails&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the difficult one. I was working on a python based GUI to play music on a Raspberry Pi 3 with a touch screen, but that isn&#x27;t going so well. The app works great, but the touch screen is giving me troubles.

It will contain the same music I've collected, and I can use the <a href="https://github.com/austinried/subtracks" target="_blank">Subtracks</a> Android app to listen on my phone. This is nice because I can use my bluetooth headphones. I can also listen via the Nextcloud web interface when on my work computer, so that's also nice. It has web radio functionlity built in too, so I can listen to radio stations such as <a href="https://somafm.com/defcon/" target="_blank">Defcon Radio</a>, <a href="https://tilderadio.org/" target="_blank">Tilderadio</a>, or <a href="https://anonradio.net/" target="_blank">aNONradio</a>.

I'm leaning more toward the USB drive, because it will then be separate from the server itself, and technically you're not supposed to use an SD card higher than 32gb on the Pi 3B+ (though apparently it usually works anyway even though it's not officially supported).</p><p><strong>Post 014/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Raspberry Pi RAID</h1><p><em>2023.10.30</em></p><p>I recently decided to <a href="/thoughts/nextcloud-music">move to Nextcloud Music</a>, which was all great and well, however my Raspberry Pi that I am running Nextcloud on didn't have enough space to store my music library. It is 41.5 GB and the Raspberry Pi has a 32 GB SD card.</p><p>Per a conversation on Mastodon, <a href="https://82mhz.net" target="_blank">82mhz</a> explained his RAID 1 setup with 2 USB drives on a Raspberry Pi. He wrote up a <a href="https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/10/using-two-usb-sticks-as-a-raid-on-a-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank">post explaining how he did this</a>, which I used to set up the same thing on mine. It was simple and I had no issues! Thanks 82mhz for writing that up!</p><p>I then needed to move my Nextcloud files to a new location, so it would store on the RAID. Nextcloud doesn't officially support doing this, and the <a href="https://help.nextcloud.com/t/howto-change-move-data-directory-after-installation/17170" target="_blank">process for doing so</a> seems overly complicated. I found it easier to just backup my data and re-install Nextcloud with the new location. This worked and I now have my nextcloud storing to the RAID using 2 USB sticks. This should ensure that if one goes down, or even the SD card fails, I should have a copy of my data that I can restore from when setting up new hardware.</p><p>It's been a process, but I'm glad I went down this path of hosting my own things.

It is 41.5 GB and the Raspberry Pi has a 32 GB SD card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per a conversation on Mastodon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://82mhz.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;82mhz&lt;/a&gt; explained his RAID 1 setup with 2 USB drives on a Raspberry Pi. He wrote up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/10/using-two-usb-sticks-as-a-raid-on-a-raspberry-pi/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;post explaining how he did this&lt;/a&gt;, which I used to set up the same thing on mine. It was simple and I had no issues! Thanks 82mhz for writing that up!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then needed to move my Nextcloud files to a new location, so it would store on the RAID. Nextcloud doesn&#x27;t officially support doing this, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.nextcloud.com/t/howto-change-move-data-directory-after-installation/17170&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;process for doing so&lt;/a&gt; seems overly complicated. I found it easier to just backup my data and re-install Nextcloud with the new location. This worked and I now have my nextcloud storing to the RAID using 2 USB sticks. This should ensure that if one goes down, or even the SD card fails, I should have a copy of my data that I can restore from when setting up new hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s been a process, but I&#x27;m glad I went down this path of hosting my own things. I feel much more in control of my data and it&#x27;s not stored/owned by some corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post 016/100 of &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/100-days-to-offload&quot;&gt;#100DaysToOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <description><![CDATA[<h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> A Very Merry November</h1><p><em>2023.11.07</em></p><p>For some reason, I could not get as into Halloween this year as I normally am. I'm unsure why that was, but October really flew by. That's not to say that we didn't do our usual traditions, but I just wasn't feeling it day-to-day like I regularly do in October.</p><p>Due to that, I am now feeling very excited for Christmas far too early. I usually try to hold off on Christmas music until after Thanksgiving, and we don't even put up decorations or anything until December, but I'm really feeling the Christmas cheer creeping in and I'm not really stopping it.</p><p>In general I tend to think in "should" and "should not". As in "I should not be partaking in Christmasy things until later in the month", but I'm trying to break that habit. Why not? I would rather spend my life doing what feels right at whatever moment, despite the narrative about it I've cemented in my mind.</p><p>I just finished listening to an older season of the <a href="https://www.ruritania.co.uk/stories" target="_blank">Christmas Stories</a> podcast. The one I finished was <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ruritania/sets/deadvent-calendar" target="_blank">The Deadvent Calendar</a> which was absolutely fantastic. These stories always are. It's one of my favorite things that I look forward to each year, and I'm excited for this year's to start on December 1st. I only started listening to it a couple of years ago, so I still have <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ruritania/sets/the-adventure-calendar-of-mr" target="_blank">Adventure Calendar of Mr Timothy Hope</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ruritania/sets/the-apartment-store" target="_blank">The Apartment Store</a>, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ruritania/sets/an-all-too-magical-christmas" target="_blank">An All Too Magical Christmas</a> left to listen to. I think I might try to listen to one or two more leading up to December.</p><p>I also read the <a href="https://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/3008-984/Stranger-Things-Winter-Special-one-shot" target="_blank">Stranger Things Winter Special</a> comic, and it was fantastic! Everyone is explaining various classic Christmas specials to Eleven, but she has no concept of any of it, so it shows what she pictures in her mind, which is a lot more dark and often quite hilarious. It might be my favorite ST comic I've read to date.</p><p>I was listening to the <a href="https://somafm.com/deptstore/" target="_blank">SomaFM Department Store Christmas</a> station, which I just found this year and love, but it shut down a few days ago and says it'll return on November 25th. I'll be happy to tune in again once it's back up.</p><p>I'm looking forward to listening to the <a href="https://bethkempton.com/ccpodcast-shownotes/" target="_blank">Calm Christmas Podcast</a>, which starts up again tomorrow, November 8th! (I actually think it might be tonight my time, since the host is in the UK). I've listened to it every year it's been out, and I also love the <a href="https://bethkempton.com/calmchristmas/" target="_blank">book of the same name</a> that it is based on.</p><p>So anyway, I'm full on into Christmas over here, and I'm going to enjoy it instead of feeling like I'm doing something wrong.  <span class="emoji">&#127876;</span></p><p><strong>Post 019/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<h1><span class="emoji">&#128216;</span> Power Animal Meditation</h1><p>I don't remember where I found the instructions for this meditation, but the idea is you sit in a meditation position, close your eyes, take some deep breaths, and envision yourself walking through a tunnel. As you go through the tunnel you drop your fears and concerns. When you exit the tunnel you will be somewhere and that is where you will meet  your power animal.</p><p>The result of this was nothing like what I expected, which made it feel even more profound.</p><p><strong>Here was my experience:</strong></p><p>I entered the dark cave with thoughts of what I expected to find. After being engulfed in complete darkness, the walls suddenly lit up, emitting a soft blue glow. Along with ornate lines, I found a reflection of my expectations etched into the wall. A crow, a squirrel, and a hummingbird. It is as if my thoughts were absorbed by the wall, now it's to keep.</p><p>I exited the tunnel into a stunning view of a forest. The trees were thick and you could see a beautiful mountain far away, covered in fog. Right at the edge of the trees was an opening into a clearing. It was shaded and cool with fallen trees and moss everywhere. A stream was flowing to the right.</p><p>I looked around expectantly, glancing up to see if there were any crows. Everything was silent and I was completely alone. I decided to sit on a log and wait.</p><p>Not long after I sat and cleared my mind, I saw movement. Fish were jumping out of the stream. I glanced over and found a large grizzly bear catching fish.</p><p>I walked over and asked the bear if it was my power animal. It looked at me curiously, silent. It moved closer and sat facing me in a meditation pose and gestured for me to do the same. I sat and we both closed our eyes. The bear morphed into a wispy light which shot over and entered my body, becoming part of me. With the power of my animal awoken, I got up and exited back through the tunnel.</p><p><strong>Post 021/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p>]]></description>

Time off for Thanksgiving is a large part of the reason. I didn't get any posts written that week I believe, and only one last week. Actually, I think I was a week or so ahead, and 2 a week would be more than 100 posts, so maybe I'm just back on track as opposed to ahead. I don't feel like mathing out where I should be. I'm just going to try to get more posts done so I don't actually fall behind or fall behind further.</p><h2 id="Mastodon">Mastodon</h2><p>I've just not been feeling Mastodon lately. I think I may just take some time off from it. I don't think I'll even post this there. It just often feels like it doesn't provide a ton given the time I put in to reading every post in my feed. I much prefer emails. Feel free to send me one if you'd like! <a href="mailto:0xdstn@protonmail.com">0xdstn@protonmail.com</a></p><h2 id="Advent of Code">Advent of Code</h2><p>Still going on this! I skipped day 5 part 2, because it was incredibly difficult and I don't care enough to put more time into that. I did however finish 6, so all I have left that is available at the time of writing this is today's, day 7. I hear it's difficult, so we'll see if I get it done. I may be getting close to my limit for this year, but I'll stick it out as long as it stays fun.</p><h2 id="Toki Pona">Toki Pona</h2><p>I've decided to start attempting to learn toki pona again. I am trying out Anki this time. It seems to be going well actually, I think I've learned a couple new words and gotten more confident on the ones that were less automatic for me. I already know most toki pona words, but I have some that are really difficult to get to stick for some reason. Hoping this will result in me knowing all of them. I then will work on reading things such as <a href="https://liputenpo.org/" target="_blank">lipu tenpo</a>. I'd also like to write more in toki pona, either in my journal or on here. I did write a haiku the other day:</p><blockquote>telo sewi o<br>telo mute lon ale<br>kasi li pona</blockquote><p>This roughly translates to:</p><blockquote>rain!<br>a lot of water is on everything<br>the plant is happy</blockquote><p><strong>Post 026/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p>]]></description>

I have a few ideas about how I want to do this, but here are some ideas:</p><h2 id="Quarterly focus">Quarterly focus</h2><p>I'm considering setting a focus for each quarter around something I'd like to learn more about. Here is a rough plan:</p><ul><li>Q1 (JAN-MAR): Witchcraft</li><li>Q2 (APR-JUN): Buddhism</li><li>Q3 (JUL-SEP): Bug Bounty</li><li>Q4 (OCT-DEC): Writing</li></ul><p>I'm not going to hold myself to these in the sense that I won't learn about anything else during those months, but I'd like to have a more focused plan for learning about specific topics.</p><p>I will also adjust them if I don't feel like doing one in a particular quarter. It'll be a work in progress as I go.</p><p>I will also continue learning about other topics throughout these, such as art, nature, etc.</p><p>As I learn about these things, I will be taking notes in <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> and sometimes transcribe the notes to this site or my physical notebooks (Bullet Journal and/or Book of Shadows).</p><h2 id="Reading">Reading</h2><p>As I mentioned in my <a href="/thoughts/reading-goals">previous post about reading goals</a>, I decided this year to switch to my own <a href="/books">book tracking system</a> and not set a goal for myself.</p><p>With this shift, I ended up not reading very many. If I don't finish anything else in the next two weeks, I will have read 16 books, which is the lowest amount I've ever read since before 2019.</p><p>I like the fact that I'm managing my books with my own system, so I will keep that up, however I don't like how I did not prioritize reading. While reading goals can cause me to read a bunch of small things to hit the goal, at least I was reading. I just simply have not read as much as I'd like this year.</p><p>I have decided that in 2024 I will set a goal again. I am going to set it to 30, which I know I can hit, and may even exceed.</p><p>I am hoping that this will motivate me to read more again, as I'm pretty disappointed with the amount of books I've read this year. This will also hopefully help me abandon books I'm not really into, which has been a challenge for me in the past. If I am not reading something, maybe I'm not actually interested in it and I should switch to something more interesting.</p><p>I'm looking forward to 2024 being another reading year, as the last few years have been prior to 2023.</p><h2 id="Art">Art</h2><p>I tend to get in my own way with art, expecting myself to sit down and do something detailed and focused every time. I would like to switch to doing this sometimes, but mostly just drawing quick things every day. I've tried this before, but I'm going to give it a go again, with a healthier mindset. I will not expect myself to draw every single day, but I will still challenge myself to do it as many days as I can, and get close to every day. I will do a small drawing with a fountain pen of something in my life. It doesn't have to be detailed or painted or written about or laid out in a fancy way. I just want to draw little glimpses of my days.</p><p>A huge inspiration for this is the Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carnetsbruns/" target="_blank">carnetsbruns</a>. They post weekly collections of small and messy ink drawings from life. I'd like to do the same. I will plan to post them in groups (probably not exactly every week though) in my <a href="/art">art section</a>.</p><h2 id="Health">Health</h2><p>I really need to get my health under control, so I will work on making small changes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen" target="_blank">Kaizen style</a>). I want to get in a habit of doing low impact physical activity daily and making more mindful choices about what I eat and how much I eat. I may try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting" target="_blank">intermittent fasting</a> and cutting down sugar again. Both of those have helped me with weight management in the past, as well as making me feel better in general.</p><p>I am hoping to make 2024 a great year!</p><p><strong>Post 030/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Technology Usage</h1><p>I have long struggled with balancing <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>convenience</strong>. In an ideal world, I would only use software that is open source and does not track me or have ads. In practice, this is not an easy feat by any means. I have gone through times of attempting to switch everything I use to more privacy conscious and/or FOSS alternatives. Some open source software is great, but some things require so many hoops and a certain level of lost productivity in order to use it over an alternative owned by a company such as Google.</p><p>I don't want to make privacy my identity, but I would like to specifically choose better options if they work well for me. If they don't, I will use what does, even if it's a system owned by a large corporation.</p><p>For instance, I am once again using Google Keep for notes on my phone. I have notes saved elsewhere, digitally and physically, but for easy notes without the risk of losing them if my phone dies, I will use Keep.</p><p>Another thing I've previously tried to abandon, but it's not worth the struggle, is Dropbox and Enpass. I use Dropbox to manage my Enpass vault, and it all just <em>works</em>. I don't want to struggle with nextcloud and keepass or something similar for very little privacy gain. I will use what works.</p><p>Because of Dropbox, I've also tended to stay away from Obsidian, but I've decided I would like to use that again for research and getting things down to be filtered into other places (this site, physical bullet journal, physical book of shadows, etc). I think it will work really well for me, and that's what I need, not extra stress of using something subpar or trying to build and manage my own.</p><p>I know this may not be a popular opinion amongst the people who read my site, but it is what works for me and I value my time more than my ideals when it comes to what technology I use. That doesn't mean that I will just mindlessly accept whatever is available though. I will always carefully pick what technologies I use. Sometimes I will build my own, sometimes I'll select something FOSS, sometimes I'll go with an application owned by a corporation because it works for me and saves me a lot of time and stress.</p><p><strong>Post 029/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p>]]></description>

It got me thinking of some things I'd like to try out. I don't know that I want to go the Manu route and give up a couple things for a whole year. I also don't know that I want to do the giving up something every month thing, but I do want to work on cutting some things out and changing how I consume other things.</p><h2 id="Coffee">Coffee</h2><p>This is a difficult one for me. I hated coffee for years, and in my early 20s, started taking a liking to it. I've since moved into loving coffee, owning multiple manual brewers, and drinking at least a cup a day, but sometimes more. I love coffee, and I do not want to remove it from my life.</p><p>That being said, I do want to change my relationship with coffee. As of writing this, I am addicted to coffee. Not only that, but I'm specifically addicted to black coffee. Drinking an espresso drink and/or tea does not work for me. Even if I have other drinks, containing the same amount of caffeine, I get a headache and/or don't feel good. Yes that sounds ridiculous, because it is.</p><p>I do not want to give up coffee entirely, but I would like to give up my addiction to it, and also make it something that I enjoy in the moment, not just something I consume every day.</p><p>Previously I exclusively drank tea before starting on coffee. I still love tea. Tea never gave me side effects when I didn't have any, and I feel better in general after drinking tea vs coffee. I would like to drink a tea each morning, and have coffee occasionally as a treat, not as a daily habit.</p><p>My plan is to slowly wean myself off of coffee so I no longer feel like I need it every day. I'll do this by lowering the amount I drink each day, and when I'm comfortable moving on to skipping days, until I've gotten through the withdrawal. At the same time I will start making a tea every morning, which should help some as I will still get caffeine.</p><p>Some benefits once I've succeeded in this will be:</p><ul><li>Making tea is much easier for me than making coffee, as there is a lot of setup and cleanup with my coffee making ritual, so I will be able to have a tea even if I'm pressed for time.</li><li>I miss drinking tea and I think it will be a calming, enjoyable activity, even if I'm doing it every day. I'll do my best to make a moment of it instead of just taking it on the go. I view this as more of a ritual vs a habit.</li><li>I will be able to have coffee sometimes as a nice drink, and thus enjoy it more when I do have it.</li><li>I won't drink coffee I don't like when I'm in a rush, just for the sake of having coffee.</li><li>I will likely drink more water. When I go to pick up a drink, I'll have water available instead of coffee.</li></ul><h2 id="Sugar">Sugar</h2><p>A year or so ago my wife and I decided to go no sugar. I avoided foods with added sugars, tried to eat foods with less natural sugar when possible, and ate no sweets at all. This was great for both of us. I felt much better, lost a few pounds, no longer craved sweets, and could even notice the sugar content in foods like fruit, so things tasted better.</p><p>I will be doing something similar, but not as intense. I will actively work on selecting foods with a low or no sugar content, avoid foods with added sugar, and only have sweets as a small treat. This means not having a giant slice of cake, or multiple cookies, but truly enjoying a piece of dark chocolate. I want my sweet consumption to be small treats that I'm fully present in enjoying, as opposed to just flying through large desserts, making myself sick and not truly enjoying it.</p><h2 id="Misc changes">Misc changes</h2><p>Those are the main two things I will be doing, but I have some other things I am starting up as well:</p><ul><li><strong>Fasting:</strong> This has helped me in the past by preventing me from eating late at night, eating too much, and making unhealthy choices because I don't have time in the morning. I will make a good effort to fast at least 16 hours each day, but I will also allow myself to break it if it makes life much more difficult (like if my family is going out to breakfast or something).</li><li><strong>Meat and dairy:</strong> Red meat and specifically dairy don't usually sit well with my stomach. I know that being vegan or vegetarian will not be possible with my current life, and I'm okay with that. I will, however, actively choose to limit these things in my diet. I will serve myself less meat and more vegetables when putting food on plates for dinner. I will choose to eat vegetarian when eating on my own, which is usually the case for breakfast and lunch. If I can opt to not have something or substitute something, without making my own food entirely while others have something else, I'll do that.</li><li><strong>Sitting:</strong> I know sitting is bad for me and I do a lot of it. I already decided that every day I am in the office (weather and other things permitting) I will take a lunch walk. I will also start switching my desk to standing mode at work more often, and work at the counter more when at home.</li></ul><h2 id="Recap">Recap</h2><p>I know this sounds like a lot, but really the coffee is the difficult/new thing here. I will easily be able to jump in to limiting sugar/meat/dairy in my diet, fasting again, and sitting less. These are just going to be things I have decided so I will do every day, while going easy on myself when I'm not doing perfectly. As long as I continue and do my best, that will be enough and they will turn into habits I don't even need to try to achieve.</p><p>So these are the things I will be doing:</p><ul><li>Breaking my coffee habit/starting a tea ritual</li><li>Limit sugar in my diet</li><li>Limit meat and dairy in my diet</li><li>Go on lunch walks</li><li>Work standing when possible</li></ul><p><strong>Post 033/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p>]]></description>

I don't want to do that. From now on I will write as often as I feel motivated to, and if I meet my goal, great, if not, oh well. If I don't do 100 posts in a year, I still wrote way more than I ever would have without deciding to join this challenge. I just want to make things because I enjoy it, and then I will share things not because I need to build a following, but because it's something I did so I'll just put it out there.</p><p>This also goes for art. I've struggled with that a lot, and wrote about it a lot. I get caught up in building an Instagram for it, or how I will make money off it, or try to force myself to draw every single day (which I always fail at within no more than a few days). I don't want to have this relationship with art. I want to create art for the sake of making art, while enjoying the process itself. I want to let go of my vision of the final product, or even my opinion of the final product, and soak in the process itself. I've read countless articles and books that tell you to stop caring about the outcome and enjoy the process, and I want to finally do that. I want to make art, any kind of art I feel inspired to make, regardless of what I feel I "should" make or what I think the outcome should be. Not only will this make it so I enjoy making art more, it will likely lead to art I like more.
