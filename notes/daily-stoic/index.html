      <div id="content"><h1 class="title">A collection of quotes and notes taken while reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HNJIJB2" target="_blank">The Daily Stoic</a> by Ryan Holiday </h1><blockquote>Stoic disciplines:<br><br><strong>The Discipline of Perception</strong> (how we see and perceive the world around us)<br><strong>The Discipline of Action</strong> (the decisions and actions we take and to what end)<br><strong>The Discipline of Will</strong> (how we deal with the things we cannot change, attain clear and convincing judgment, and come to a true understanding of our place in the world)</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Jan 1:</strong> If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Jan 2:</strong> Remember that imperative on the days you start to feel distracted, when watching television or having a snack seems like a better use of your time than reading or studying philosophy. Knowledge self-knowledge in particular is freedom.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Jan 5:</strong> "Let all your efforts be directed to something, let it keep that end in view. Its not activity that disturbs people, but false conceptions of things that drive them mad." - SENECA, ON TRANQUILITY OF MIND, 12.5</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Jan 6:</strong> Have you taken the time to get clarity about who you are and what you stand for? Or are you too busy chasing unimportant things, mimicking the wrong influences, and following disappointing or unfulfilling or nonexistent paths?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Jan 8:</strong> You must reclaim the ability to abstain because within it is your clarity and self-control.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Jan 10:</strong> If you want to be steady, if you want clarity, proper judgement is the best way.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Jan 11:</strong> Serenity and stability are results of your choices and judgment, not your environment.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Jan 13:</strong> A wise person knows what's inside their circle of control and what is outside of it.<br>...<br>According to the Stoics, the circle of control contains just one thing: YOUR MIND.<br>...<br>You've got just one thing to manage: your choices, your will, your mind.</blockquote><p>It's not easy for me to recognize things as outside of my control. I struggle with trying to control everything. I've had a couple of moments recently where recognized situations where I should let go, knowing there was nothing I could do to change it. I'm going to keep working on finding more of these moments every day. </p></div>
