      <div id="content"><h1 class="title">A collection of quotes and notes taken while reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC1JAI" target="_blank">Meditations</a> by Marcus Aurelius</h1><blockquote><strong>1.13:</strong> Not to shrug off a friends resentmenteven unjustified resentment but try to put things right.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>2.5:</strong> Concentrate every minute like a Roman - like a man - on doing whats in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>2.7:</strong> Do external things distract you? Then make time for yourself to learn something worthwhile; stop letting yourself be pulled in all directions.</blockquote><p>This really hits home with my struggles surrounding what it is I "do". I tend to pick up a lot of different things, absorb myself in it, stress myself out, and ignore the important things around me. I need to stop letting the concepts of who I am as defined by what I do lead my life. I need to find good hobbies that don't cause all of these negetive side effects, and make sure I'm still staying present, not getting so absorbed with it.</p><blockquote><strong>2.11:</strong> You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.</blockquote><p>I've been getting better about occasionally thinking this throught the day. I've been considering getting a <a href="https://dailystoic.com/memento-mori/" target="_blank">momento mori</a> tattoo on my arm to serve as a constant reminder, or maybe just get a <a href="https://prints.dailystoic.com/products/memento-mori" target="_blank">coin</a>.</p><blockquote><strong>4.24:</strong> Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you'll have more time, and more tranquility. Ask yourself at every moment, "Is this necessary"?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>5.33:</strong> Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself.</blockquote><p>I've definitely flipped these two things, and I don't want to do that anymore.</p><blockquote><strong>6.53:</strong> Practice really hearing what people say. Do your best to get inside their minds.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>7.4:</strong> Focus on what is said when you speak and on what results from each action. Know what the one aims at, and what the other means.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>7.67:</strong> Its quite possible to be a good man without anyone realizing it. Remember that.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>10.3:</strong> If its endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining. If its unendurable, then stop complaining.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>10.16:</strong> To stop talking about what the good man is like, and just be one.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>11.16:</strong> Learn to be indifferent to what makes no difference.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>11.18 vii:</strong> Be willing to give up thinking of this as a catastrophe - and your anger is gone.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>11.18 viii:</strong> How much more damage anger and grief do than the things that cause them.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>11.18:</strong> When you start to lose your temper, remember: Theres nothing manly about rage. Its courtesy and kindness that define a human being - and a man. Thats who possesses strength and nerves and guts, not the angry whiners.</blockquote><p>Anger problems are very difficult to overcome, specially if you've let it grow deep inside you, always ready to come out and strike whenever provoked. There is nothing manly or powerful about rage. It's a weakness pretending to be tough.</p></div>
