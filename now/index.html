<a href="/~dustin/">..</a><h1 id="Now">Now</h1><p>This is my <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">now page</a>, where you can find what I'm currently up to.</p><p><em>Last updated: July 2022</em></p><p>This now page used to just display the same stuff with the what I'm reading/listening to changing occasionally. Instead, I'm going to update it each month with what I'm focusing on (sometimes updating throughout the month).</p><h2 id="Art">Art</h2><p>I've started trying out more nature/green sketching. It's not always easy to make time to draw/paint but I do it when I can. I've recently purchased a couple books on the subject. One, which I'm currently reading, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1529070309" target="_blank">The Green Sketching Handbook</a>.</p><h2 id="Reading">Reading</h2><p>I've been meaning to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BDG5Z8Y" target="_blank">Wabi Sabi</a> for a while now, and am finally getting to it. I really love Beth Kempton's writing, and I'm glad to finally pick this one up.</p><h2 id="Podcasts + Audiobooks">Podcasts + Audiobooks</h2><p>I've been listening to  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZODPOC" target="_blank">The House at Pooh Corner</a> with the kids whenever we have time. There was a lot more time during commute to school, but we'll get through it eventually.</p><p>I started a new daily podcast listening habit with the following each weekday morning:</p><ul><li><a href="https://link.chtbl.com/radioheadspace" target="_blank">Radio Headspace</a></li><li><a href="https://www.birdnote.org/listen/birdnote-daily" target="_blank">BirdNote Daily</a> (including weekends)</li><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily-dad/id1490007487" target="_blank">The Daily Dad</a></li></ul><h2 id="Birding">Birding</h2><p>I recently started getting into birding. I've loved birds for a long time now, but I'm finally actually diving into the subject. I received a monocular with a phone attachment as a gift, so I can take pictures of birds farther away using my phone, and it's been great!</p><p>I've photographed and identified the following this month:</p><ul><li>House Sparrow (male and female)</li><li>European Starling (male and juvenile)</li><li>American Robin (male and juvenile)</li></ul><p>I have been using the <a href="https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/" target="_blank">Merlin Bird ID app</a> to identify the birds in my photographs. It also has a nice sound ID, which I've used a few times without seeing the birds it was picking up.</p><h2 id="Gardening">Gardening</h2><p>We set up our planter boxes again this year, and everything is thriving! We have the following:</p><ul><li>Mini Watermelon</li><li>Green Peas</li><li>Strawberries</li><li>Coolapeno Peppers</li><li>Romaine Lettuce</li><li>Raspberry (this grows on it's own in our yard every year, it just popped up on it's own)</li></ul><p>This is also year two of our lilac bushes, and they're doing well.</p><p>A little over a year ago I got a small venus fly trap. In the spring it started flowering, and I read that you should cut the flower stem before it actually blooms a flower, as it takes a lot of energy and may kill the plant. I found this out very late and thought it wasn't going to make it, but it suddenly started doing better and now it's doing great. It even started catching fruit flies and a larger fly that was way too big for the trapper it was in. It's just kind of sitting there in it now. I suppose it'll slowly degrade and get absorbed.</p><p>I have a bonsai growing kit I'd like to start, so I will try to do that this month at some point.</p>		</article>
