<a href="/~dustin/">..</a><h1 id="Now">Now</h1><p><em>Last updated: November 2022</em></p><p>This is my <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">now page</a>, where you can find what I'm currently up to.</p><p>This now page used to just display the same stuff with the what I'm reading/listening to changing occasionally. Instead, I'm going to update it each month with what I'm focusing on (sometimes updating throughout the month).</p><p>You can see previous monthly updates in the <a href="/~dustin/then">then section</a>.</p><h2 id="Work">Work</h2><p>After about a month of being unemployed, I accepted a job offer and started at the end of November. Finding a job went much quicker than I anticipated.</p><h2 id="Covid">Covid</h2><p>After about two and a half years of avoiding it (somehow) someone in my household tested positive for covid. It took a few weeks to have negative tests for everyone, but we are now covid-free. Only about half of us got it and it didn't seem to be too bad of a strain.</p><h2 id="Birds">Birds</h2><p>I set up a window bird feeder over the summer for viewing birds as they came to eat. Unfortunately they never went over to it, but I left it up and now that winter is approaching, we've had quite a few visitors!</p><p>These are the birds I saw this month:</p><ul><li>Northern Flicker</li><li>House Finch (male, which I've never seen before)</li></ul><p>I also saw a hawk the closest I've seen one. It swooped down and got something off the ground and went up to a tree. I was in the car so it was only for a moment, but it was really cool to see.</p>		</article>
