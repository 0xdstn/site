<a href="/~dustin/projects">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128187;</span> Books</h1><p>I had been feeling that Goodreads was not the best tool for me to manage my books. Here are some of the reasons:</p><ul><li>It's a clunky tool that can take a lot of time to tag a bunch of books, etc</li><li>I don't need the social aspect of it, it's just another thing I'm checking too often for no reason</li><li>The reading goals cause me to feel I have to read when I don't want to, or to read short things just to hit the goal</li><li>The rating and reviews didn't do much for me, so I was doing it for no reason</li></ul><p>I wanted a simpler solution, so I built my own. It consists of a series of text files which include:</p><ul><li>Year read lists (2022-read.txt, 2021-read.txt, etc)</li><li>To read list</li><li>Currently reading list</li></ul><p>There is a <strong>generate.py</strong> file which takes these in and generates the following on a site:</p><ul><li>A currently reading list</li><li>Yearly read lists</li><li>A to-read list with links for tags</li><li>List of books for each tag</li><li>A list of all tags with counts</li></ul><p>Management is simple as it's just text files of books/authors (and tags in one of them) that I can edit in vim. It doesn't do counts for the year. There are no goals. It's just a history of the books I want to read and the books I've read, which is exactly what I needed.</p><ul><li>Source code: <a href="https://github.com/0xdstn/books/" target="_blank">https://github.com/0xdstn/books/</a></li><li>Live version: <a href="https://tilde.town/~dustin/books/" target="_blank">https://tilde.town/~dustin/books/</a></li></ul><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
