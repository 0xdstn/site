<a href="/~dustin/then">..</a><h1 id="August 2022">August 2022</h1><h2 id="Witchcraft">Witchcraft</h2><p>A while back I bought a Humble Book Bundle of books on magic and witchcraft. I've been meaning to pick one up since I purchased it, as it's something I am interested in learning about.</p><p>I've been reading a fiction book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085C71YG5" target="_blank">The Once and Future Witches</a>, and it got me interested in looking into it, so I've finally started.</p><p>Currently I am listening to <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/B07341TVCT" target="_blank">Everyday Witchcraft</a> with plans to start on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005HTNGQY" target="_blank">Drawing Down the Moon</a> soon. I also read a lot online about a variety of witchy topics such as tarot, runes, kitchen witchery, etc.</p><p>As with most things, I'm not going to dive into wicca with their gods and all of that, but instead view witchcraft in a more secular way, just like I do with Buddhism. I will probably write an article at some point about the crossover between Buddhism and witchcraft.</p><h2 id="Tarot">Tarot</h2><p>One of the things I'm starting with is tarot, as I already own a <a href="https://pixeloccult.com/neonmoontarot/" target="_blank">tarot deck</a>, and I discovered the <a href="https://app.labyrinthos.co/" target="_blank">Labrynthos apps</a>. I am currently using the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.labyrinthos.app" target="_blank">Labrythos Tarot</a> app for daily readings and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.luminous.spirit.app" target="_blank">Luminous Spirit Tarot</a> app for setting intentions that align with the phases of the moon. I am also using the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrustonapps.mymoonphase" target="_blank">My Moon Phase</a> app to view the current and upcoming phases.</p><p>Something I read online while looking into all of this was that you should view tarot for self reflection as opposed to fortune telling. I've realized that when you strip away the witchy exterior of witchcraft, all that remains is the concepts of being self reflective and appreciating nature and the world around you. These concepts are already something that I've aligned with, so adding witchcraft is just another set of tools I can use.</p><h2 id="Synchronicity">Synchronicity</h2><p>Something I've been interested in for a while now is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity" target="_blank">Synchronicity</a>. The gist of it is that you will notice coincidences in your life, and that they will actually lead you to important things. Whether these are some cosmic sign, or our minds subconsciously noticing things that lead us to what we truly want or need, it brings you to the same result.</p><p>I've been trying to notice these types of occurrences for a while, but they seemed to pick up as I started looking into witchcraft. One of the most notable ones was that I've been reading books and thinking about witchcraft in general, and then I looked at a bookstore in Seaside, OR as we drove by it, and in the display case I saw one book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250279542" target="_blank">Kickass Coven</a>. I feel like that is the kind of thing that would be displayed along with other witchy things in the middle of October, or at least during fall, but here it was in the middle of summer, and it's the only thing I noticed in a brief second while zipping by. However this happened, it feels like a sign that I'm on the right path.</p><p>Another significant one was that once I got to the point of looking into the moon and it's cycles, it turned out that exact night was a new moon. I was looking into witchcraft for about a week or so prior to this, but just so happened to touch on that specific aspect at that specific time.</p><p>I've always been pretty skeptical about there actually being supernatural things out there, but I'm gaining a new view on this type of thing. Maybe there is magic, maybe the world is more in sync than you would think. Maybe the universe is actually behind all religions and gods, and it just reveals itself to people in a way that resonates with them the most. Maybe it's all just coincidence and the true power is noticing and leading ourselves. Whatever it is, I'm going to keep paying attention to these types of events and reading into it however makes sense for me.</p><h2 id="Birding">Birding</h2><p>During a trip to Seaside, OR, I saw quite a few birds:</p><ul><li>American Crow</li><li>Dark-eyed Junco</li><li>Great Egret</li><li>Western Gull</li><li>California Gull</li><li>Semipalmated Sandpiper</li><li>Great Blue Heron</li></ul><p>I was very excited to see the sandpipers, as I had never seen them before.</p><p>Crows are my favorite bird, and there were a ton of them everywhere we went.</p>		</article>
