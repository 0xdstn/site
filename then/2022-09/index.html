<a href="/~dustin/then">..</a><h1 id="September 2022">September 2022</h1><h2 id="General">General</h2><p>I've realized that I will likely not be hitting my reading goal this year. I have started and stopped way too many books, and thus I fell behind. As of September 1st I was at 15/30, and there just isn't enough time to hit that. I am working to accept this as okay, and allow myself to just read what I want to read at the pace I want to go, as opposed to trying really hard to catch up with this arbitrary goal.</p><h2 id="Spooky things">Spooky things</h2><p>As fall approaches, I am getting more into witchy things and ghost stories. I have been listening to <a href="https://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/shows/scary-stories-told-in-the-dark/" target="_blank">Otis Jiry's Scary Stories Told in the Dark</a>, and they are great. I'm starting from the beginning and I'm only 3 episodes in, but number 2 and 3 were fantastic (1 was good too) and I'm really looking forward to the rest of these. After thinking a lot about the horror genre and what I like, I find that I prefer paranormal/supernatural horror and that's pretty much it. I also really like found footage stories and urban legends/folklore. I'm not a fan of gore, killers, etc. I just want a spooky story, specially ones that leave holes for the reader's imagination to fill in.</p><h2 id="Witchcraft">Witchcraft</h2><p>I am currently learning about witchcraft and how that can fit into my life and how I can benefit from it.</p><p>This month I listening to <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/B07341TVCT" target="_blank">Everyday Witchcraft</a> and plan to start on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005HTNGQY" target="_blank">Drawing Down the Moon</a> soon.</p><h2 id="Sugar">Sugar</h2><p>My wife is currently trying to break her addiction to sugar by doing a no added sugar (and limiting sugar per day) detox. I'm also doing no added sugar in things, and a couple of things have come from it:</p><ol><li>I have learned how impressively high the added sugar is in most foods</li><li>I have lost a few pounds and am feeling good</li><li>I've been in general more aware of what I'm consuming</li></ol><p>This is usually the time of year that my sugar intake spikes between pumpkin spice lattes, Halloween candy, and Christmas treats. I made some <a href="/~dustin/recipes/vegan-pumpkin-spice-sauce">vegan pumpkin spice sauce</a> to make PSLs at home and I really like it!</p><p>All in all it's been great and I plan to continue limiting added sugar consumption moving forward.</p>		</article>
