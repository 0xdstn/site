<a href="/~dustin/then">..</a><h1 id="October 2022">October 2022</h1><h2 id="Reading">Reading</h2><p>It's looking more like I might hit my reading goal. Last month I thought I wasn't going to because I was so far behind, but I went from 15 books on 9/1 to 23 books on 9/30. It'll now be unlikely that I don't make my goal this year, and I'll probably even surpass it.</p><h2 id="Art">Art</h2><p>I have been working on drawing more lately. I completed a 7 day inktober challenge from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sdionbakerdesign/" target="_blank">Samantha Dion Baker</a> (one of my favorite artists) called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CjBIwtMuAlw/" target="_blank">Morning till Night</a>. For the first 7 days of October you do a drawing/painting of what you do at a specified time of day. Posts can be viewed on Instagram via the hashtag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/samanthaandohnmar7day/" target="_blank">#samanthaandohnmar7day</a>. I might post them here at some point.</p><p>After I finish this challenge, I think I am going to try to do more quick sketches, inspired by the book I'm currently reading, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1DT2QK" target="_blank">Sketch Now, Think Later</a>.</p><p>In addition to that, I am going to continue doing more detailed sketch journalling, similar to what Samantha Dion Baker does, also inspired by her book that I just finished, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HL83XYS" target="_blank">Draw Your World</a>.</p><p>As I start to do more sketching, I will find a good way to post them here. I may make a new section with a separate RSS feed for sketch posts.</p><h2 id="Work">Work</h2><p>Unfortunately on October 11th I was notified that there were some huge cuts happening at my company and that I was being laid off. It all happened so fast and unexpected. I had until the end of that day before I lost access to all work systems, and was on the payroll until that Friday. I got a decent severance which should be enough to get by for about 3 months. I've never had to deal with anything like this and it is very difficult to deal with.</p><p>As the month comes to a close I am doing freelance work again, I filed for unemployment (which may not be approved anymore, because of the freelance work, waiting on a decision regarding that), and I have a few promising places I'm interviewing with.</p><p>It'll all work out in the end but these are some anxious and trying times.</p>		</article>
