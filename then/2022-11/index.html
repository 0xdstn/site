<a href="/~dustin/then">..</a><h1 id="November 2022">November 2022</h1><h2 id="Work">Work</h2><p>After about a month of being unemployed, I accepted a job offer and started at the end of November. Finding a job went much quicker than I anticipated.</p><h2 id="Covid">Covid</h2><p>After about two and a half years of avoiding it (somehow) someone in my household tested positive for covid. It took a few weeks to have negative tests for everyone, but we are now covid-free. Only about half of us got it and it didn't seem to be too bad of a strain.</p><h2 id="Birds">Birds</h2><p>I set up a window bird feeder over the summer for viewing birds as they came to eat. Unfortunately they never went over to it, but I left it up and now that winter is approaching, we've had quite a few visitors!</p><p>These are the birds I saw this month:</p><ul><li>Northern Flicker</li><li>House Finch (male, which I've never seen before)</li></ul><p>I also saw a hawk the closest I've seen one. It swooped down and got something off the ground and went up to a tree. I was in the car so it was only for a moment, but it was really cool to see.</p><h2 id="Books finished">Books finished</h2><p><strong> <span class="emoji">&#128216;</span> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007JLK8TQ" target="_blank">Krampus: The Yule Lord</a> by Brom</strong></p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It started out pretty slow when it was primarily focusing on the main human character, but it eventually picked up and never slowed down.</p><p>I loved all the mythology tie-ins and it felt well thought out. It also had a lot of gratifying outcomes int he end. I don't care much for the gore depicted, and it shows the worst sides of humanity which was upsetting at times, but it all seemed appropriate for such a story.</p><p><strong> <span class="emoji">&#128216;</span> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0084AMPH4" target="_blank">A Kidnapped Santa Claus</a> by L. Frank Baum</strong></p><p>A short but great book. I loved the first one (The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus) so this was a nice added story to that one.</p><p><strong> <span class="emoji">&#128216;</span> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1529045223" target="_blank">A Poem for Every Autumn Day</a> by Allie Esiri</strong></p><p>This was fine. There were a few really good ones, but oddly a ton of them were about war, which I wasn't a fan of. I expected more.. fall themed poems.</p><h2 id="Site updates">Site updates</h2><ul><li><strong>2022-11-29</strong> <a href="/~dustin/writing/mastodon">Returning to Mastodon</a></li><li><strong>2022-11-20</strong> <a href="/~dustin/recipes/rice-pudding">Rice Pudding</a></li></ul>		</article>
