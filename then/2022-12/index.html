<a href="/~dustin/then">..</a><h1 id="December 2022">December 2022</h1><h2 id="Birds">Birds</h2><p>We have a new visitor that's taken over our bird feeder - <strong>Dark-eyed Junkos</strong>. It seems they may have taken over, as the house finches haven't been stopping by anymore, or at least not as often.</p><p>We also had two Northern Flickers visit our hanging bird feeder!</p><p>These are the birds I saw this month:</p><ul><li>Dark-eyed Junko</li><li>House Finch</li><li>Northern Flicker</li></ul><h2 id="Reading">Reading</h2><p>I decided Goodreads isn't the best book management solution for me personally, so I created my own tool. You can see it and more about it here:</p><ul><li>Project post: <a href="/~dustin/projects/books">Books</a></li><li>Source code: <a href="https://github.com/0xdstn/books/" target="_blank">https://github.com/0xdstn/books/</a></li><li>Live version: <a href="https://tilde.town/~dustin/books/" target="_blank">https://tilde.town/~dustin/books/</a></li></ul><p>I actually didn't finish any books in December. I went into the month at 30 books, which was my goal. I started a couple of books, but didn't manage to get all the way through them.</p><p>Moving forward I want to improve my relationship to reading. Aside from no longer using goodreads, I am also not going to set a yearly goal, and be more relaxed about what and when I read.</p><h2 id="Listening">Listening</h2><p>I finished <a href="https://www.ruritania.co.uk/stories" target="_blank">The Elf Service</a>, the latest Christms Stories Podcast series. I really enjoyed this, as I do every year.</p><p>I also started <a href="https://www.grimandmild.com/12ghosts" target="_blank">12 Ghosts</a>, but did not finish before December ended. I will finish it up in January. I love the <a href="https://www.grimandmild.com/13days" target="_blank">13 Days of Halloween</a> podcast. This one is similar, but ghost stories for Christmas time. So far it's been great.</p>		</article>
