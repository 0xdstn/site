<a href="/~dustin/then">..</a><h1 id="January 2023">January 2023</h1><h2 id="Birds">Birds</h2><p>I saw a <strong>Red-tailed Hawk</strong> on the side of the road eating some sort of animal. Near it a <strong>Black-billed Magpie</strong> waited for it's turn.</p><p>There were about 20 <strong>European Starling</strong> at the hanging bird feeder we have in our tree in the backyard. They swarmed our yard, filling the tree branches and the ground below the feeder. They are very aggressive with the other birds.</p><p>We decided to go to a spot that is notorious for having bald eagles, and it did not disappoint. There were a lot of people set up with big fancy cameras, and we saw multiple bald eagles. I've never seen one in the wild before, so that was really exciting!</p><p>Amusingly, while driving down a highway we thought there was an owl up on a telephone pole in the middle of the day, which was very strange. Upon closer inspection it turns out it was an owl carving! It looked very realistic and resembled a Great Horned Owl.</p><p>I happened to see a second <strong>Red-tailed Hawk</strong> on top of a light in a parking lot. I was about to take a picture of it perched, and it took off! My photo captured it mid flight, which was great! It was pretty far away and I didn't have my birding equipment with me, so it wasn't super clear but I'm still happy that I caught it flying.</p><p>These are the birds I saw this month:</p><ul><li>Red-tailed Hawk</li><li>Black-billed Magpie</li><li>European Starling</li><li>Bald Eagle</li></ul><h2 id="Reading">Reading</h2><p>I finished the following books this month:</p><ul><li>In a Holidaze by Christina Lauren</li><li>Be Free Where You Are by Thich Nhat Hanh</li><li>Instagram for Illustrators by Mike Lowrey</li><li>Drawn In by Julia Rothman</li></ul><h2 id="Listening">Listening</h2><p>I finished the <a href="https://www.grimandmild.com/bridgewater" target="_blank">Bridgewater</a> podcast. I started it a long time ago but never finished. I thought it was pretty good. It was odd that I decided to pick this back up, as the second season was announced a couple days after I finished it. Looking forward to that!</p><p>I finished the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rebel-robin-surviving-hawkins-a-stranger-things-podcast/id1571208591" target="_blank">Rebel Robin</a> podcast. It is a Stranger Things story that takes place in the 3rd season. I really enjoyed it. It dove deeper into Robin's character. It's a companion podcast to the book of the same name, so I'm looking forward to reading that at some point.</p><h2 id="Art">Art</h2><p>I'm currently trying to really get serious about an art practice. I've been reading a lot of books on art and am practicing and trying to figure out what I want to focus on with it. I'm considering posting art here, so that may come eventually.</p><p>I've done some reflecting on what kind of art I want to make, particularly subject matter, and I am planning to focus on nature sketching. I like drawing/painting landscapes, pieces of nature, etc. I have some books on the subject that I will read next. I am also interested in urban sketching, and I think I will keep that as a secondary subject that I do occasionally. I have a couple of books on it that I will read after the nature ones. These help me connect with the world around me, which is really what I'm going for with my art.</p><h2 id="Misc">Misc</h2><p>I saw two porcupines on a walk at a nature reserve! I've never seen one before so it was really exciting. One of them was far away, but the other was in a tree about 6 feet away, eating the bark. I didn't know they climbed trees or ate them. It turns out in the winter they don't hibernate and instead of their usual diet (berries, plants, etc) they pull off the outer bark and eat the inner bark of trees.</p>		</article>
