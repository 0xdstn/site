<a href="/~dustin/then">..</a><h1 id="February 2023">February 2023</h1><h2 id="Birds">Birds</h2><p>I went to the park to see what birds I could find and sketch some. I found 3 <strong>Canada Geese</strong>, a <strong>Mallard</strong>, and some <strong>American Wigeons</strong>. Two of the geese were grazing in the grass, and the other was keeping watch. As I sat sketching the two came within a foot of me. I continued what I was doing after snapping a couple photos. Shortly after the watcher came over to me and then started lowly hissing. It continued this until I got nervous enough to get up and walk away. I guess it decided I was a threat to the others.</p><p>The mallard was swimming around in a group of 7 Wigeons. They didn't seem to mind.</p><p>I heard an owl outside one night, and I think it was a <strong>Great Horned Owl</strong> after listening to local owl songs. It'll be cool if I can actually see one sometime.</p><p>On another night I managed to catch the sound of the owl on my Merlin app, and it is indeed a <strong>Great Horned Owl</strong>. It sounds pretty far away from my house though.</p><p>These are the birds I saw this month:</p><ul><li>Canada Goose</li><li>American Wigeon</li><li>Mallard</li><li>Song Sparrow</li><li>Common Raven</li></ul><h2 id="Art">Art</h2><p>I've been struggling with trying to decide what I want to do with art lately. I've done what I usually do which is create Instagram accounts and try to do something like urban sketching. Through this process I have decided a couple things:</p><ol><li>I don't like drawing  interiors or people. Those subjects never turn out how I want them to and I just don't really enjoy the process of drawing them.</li><li>Instagram is great for inspiration, but it's exhausting and distracting and I don't need one for my art. The only goal for that would be to build a community, which I don't really need, or to eventually sell my art, which I also don't really have any interest in.</li><li>I love drawing nature and documenting my life through objects and scenes.</li></ol><p>I am going to go forward without an Instagram. Instead I set up an <a href="/~dustin/art">art blog</a> for art I want to share.</p><p>I am going to stop trying to emulate others, drawing things I don't enjoy  and instead focus on what I do like, which is sketch journaling and nature/green sketching.</p><p>My goal with art is to connect with nature and people around me.</p><h2 id="Listening">Listening</h2><p>I finally finished the <a href="https://www.grimandmild.com/12ghosts" target="_blank">12 Ghosts</a> podcast. I love ghost stories and these did not disappoint. I hope they do this again next December!</p><h2 id="Watching">Watching</h2><p>I finished the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8741290/" target="_blank">Tales from the Loop</a> show. I absolutely loved it. I feel like it did great at capturing the feelings portrayed in the original book. The stories were interesting and most of them tied together. There was also a lot of emotion tied up in the stories. I would highly reccomend this.</p><h2 id="Reading">Reading</h2><p>I didn't finish any books this month and <em>that's okay</em>.</p>		</article>
