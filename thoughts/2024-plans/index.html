<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> 2024 Plans</h1><p><em>2023.12.18</em></p><p>I want to have some major personal growth next year. I have a few ideas about how I want to do this, but here are some ideas:</p><h2 id="Quarterly focus">Quarterly focus</h2><p>I'm considering setting a focus for each quarter around something I'd like to learn more about. Here is a rough plan:</p><ul><li>Q1 (JAN-MAR): Witchcraft</li><li>Q2 (APR-JUN): Buddhism</li><li>Q3 (JUL-SEP): Bug Bounty</li><li>Q4 (OCT-DEC): Writing</li></ul><p>I'm not going to hold myself to these in the sense that I won't learn about anything else during those months, but I'd like to have a more focused plan for learning about specific topics.</p><p>I will also adjust them if I don't feel like doing one in a particular quarter. It'll be a work in progress as I go.</p><p>I will also continue learning about other topics throughout these, such as art, nature, etc.</p><p>As I learn about these things, I will be taking notes in <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> and sometimes transcribe the notes to this site or my physical notebooks (Bullet Journal and/or Book of Shadows).</p><h2 id="Reading">Reading</h2><p>As I mentioned in my <a href="/thoughts/reading-goals">previous post about reading goals</a>, I decided this year to switch to my own <a href="/books">book tracking system</a> and not set a goal for myself.</p><p>With this shift, I ended up not reading very many. If I don't finish anything else in the next two weeks, I will have read 16 books, which is the lowest amount I've ever read since before 2019.</p><p>I like the fact that I'm managing my books with my own system, so I will keep that up, however I don't like how I did not prioritize reading. While reading goals can cause me to read a bunch of small things to hit the goal, at least I was reading. I just simply have not read as much as I'd like this year.</p><p>I have decided that in 2024 I will set a goal again. I am going to set it to 30, which I know I can hit, and may even exceed.</p><p>I am hoping that this will motivate me to read more again, as I'm pretty disappointed with the amount of books I've read this year. This will also hopefully help me abandon books I'm not really into, which has been a challenge for me in the past. If I am not reading something, maybe I'm not actually interested in it and I should switch to something more interesting.</p><p>I'm looking forward to 2024 being another reading year, as the last few years have been prior to 2023.</p><h2 id="Art">Art</h2><p>I tend to get in my own way with art, expecting myself to sit down and do something detailed and focused every time. I would like to switch to doing this sometimes, but mostly just drawing quick things every day. I've tried this before, but I'm going to give it a go again, with a healthier mindset. I will not expect myself to draw every single day, but I will still challenge myself to do it as many days as I can, and get close to every day. I will do a small drawing with a fountain pen of something in my life. It doesn't have to be detailed or painted or written about or laid out in a fancy way. I just want to draw little glimpses of my days.</p><p>A huge inspiration for this is the Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carnetsbruns/" target="_blank">carnetsbruns</a>. They post weekly collections of small and messy ink drawings from life. I'd like to do the same. I will plan to post them in groups (probably not exactly every week though) in my <a href="/art">art section</a>.</p><h2 id="Health">Health</h2><p>I really need to get my health under control, so I will work on making small changes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen" target="_blank">Kaizen style</a>). I want to get in a habit of doing low impact physical activity daily and making more mindful choices about what I eat and how much I eat. I may try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting" target="_blank">intermittent fasting</a> and cutting down sugar again. Both of those have helped me with weight management in the past, as well as making me feel better in general.</p><p>I am hoping to make 2024 a great year!</p><p><strong>Post 030/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
