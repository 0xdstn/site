<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Archive 81</h1><p><em>2023.09.25</em></p><p>I finally finished the <a href="https://www.archive81.com/" target="_blank">Archive 81</a> podcast and just <em>wow</em>. It has hands-down become my favorite podcast I've ever listened to.</p><p>Season one drew me in with an interesting story, good voice acting, and likeable characters. It was right up my alley: old tapes, a cult, weird occult things.</p><p>Then season 2 pivoted into such a contrastingly different and bizarre direction. It introduced a whole new world with very strange laws that defies everything in our world. It was weird and I was impressed, because after a first season like that, it could have easily gone straight down hill with nowhere else to really explore. The writers were prepared.</p><p>Season 3 is by far the best season in my opinion. It was <em>amazing</em>. It built upon the foundation of season 2, with a new cast of characters, who quickly became my favorite, and it is now one of my favorite fictional worlds. It has so much potential for more and I hope more will come.</p><p>There was also the 3 episode mini series, Left of the Dial, which felt like a continuation of season 3, but with it's own little story that started and ended with those episodes.</p><p>I'm fascinated by the world created by this podcast and I truly hope more will come eventually. The final episode was in 2019, so it's been a while. The creators were working on another podcast, but from what I can tell, that was delayed. Hopefully that one can get released sometime soon (and maybe it'll also be amazing!), and then I hope they return to this world.</p><p>It can be really out there and also graphic, but if you're into weird things, I'd highly recommend this podcast.</p><p><strong>Post 009/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
