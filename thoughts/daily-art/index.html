<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Daily Art</h1><p><em>2023.09.07</em></p><h2 id="Not working">Not working</h2><p>A little over a week ago I added a daily art page to my site. I did this with the intent to create a daily art habit, and having somewhere to post it would hold me accountable to do it every day.</p><p>This idea is all good and well, however I found it doesn't work for me. I was creating art for the sake of checking of the "made art today" box, not for enjoyment. I love drawing, and I don't want to ruin it for myself by making it a chore.</p><p>I also found that I didn't have much of a connection with what I chose to draw. I want to draw things that mean something to me, when I feel like dedicating myself fully to the process, not just speeding through a drawing of some fruit because it's what was nearby and I need to get it done before a meeting otherwise I won't get a drawing done that day.</p><p>I do want to build a near-daily if not daily art practice, but I don't think this rigid "you have to do it no matter what" model is how I will get there. I will build it organically over time by focusing on making art when I'm feeling inspired.</p><h2 id="Sharing">Sharing</h2><p>I will still share my art here on my <a href="/art">Art</a> section, I will just be removing the /dailyart page. I took the drawings from the last couple of weeks and put them in a post: <a href="/art/art-dump-001">Art Dump 001</a></p><p>I think I may put up a post at the end of every week with any art I made during that week.</p><p>In addition to sharing on my site, I'll put up a post with attached images on Mastodon each time I post on my site, and I will post daily on Mastodon during Inktober.</p><p>I also have some private groups I will be sharing in, a local Urban Sketchers Facebook group, and a virtual nature journaling group. Sharing somewhere like that evokes much more interaction in a nice, positive way.</p><h2 id="Inktober">Inktober</h2><p>I am planning to do Inktober again this year. I only ever completed it once (2020) and tried and failed to keep with it every other year since about 2016 or so. I will be following the official prompt list, but maybe try to draw from life for each of them. I'm not quite sure yet, but we'll see when we get there.</p><p>I want to get my children involved with it this year as well, so I am planning to buy them each a little notebook, so it can be something we do together and also help keep me motivated. I'm looking forward to seeing how they interpret each prompt!</p><p><strong>Post 003/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
