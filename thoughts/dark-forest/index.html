      <div id="content"><h2>Dark forest</h2><p><em>June 6th, 2019</em></p><p>I just read through a two part article about <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1" target="_blank">The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet</a>, which really resonated with me.</p><p>In my original days of using the internet over a decade ago, I used to post anything I wanted, without filter, under my own name. I didn't care about the likes (originaly this wasn't even a concept that existed) or the fact that I might be shouting into the void. I just shared because that is what the platform was for. That is what I wanted to do - share.</p><p>I have struggled with the last 5 or so years with my online identity. I have created countless pseudonyms, and even paraded as myself with my real name. I have gone in and out of mindsets where I feel privacy is the aboslute most important thing to be concerned with online, and being completely open.</p><p>I'm sure a lot of this is caused by the fact that I became an adult on the internet, and who I am now is not who I was then. A lot has changed, and most of all my opinions on everything have changed.</p><p>I feel like running around on the internet under a pseudonym doesn't provide much. Privacy isn't about hiding who I am, it's about being selective about what I share. I don't need to blast out photos of my familiy and my every whereabouts publicly, that is a good use for a dark forest such as my private Facebook or Instagram.</p><p>I have been fighting against technology instead of allowing it to make my life better. Allowing it to make me more connected to the outside world. This connectivity to other humans is the true power of the internet, once you push through all of the noise. The excessive bits of the internet are new, the conversation and personal connections have always been there.</p><p>I want to be more open, in a careful way, online. The things that I have added to this site are really a true representation of my thoughts and interests. I don't need to hide those behind a moniker.</p><p>My name is <a href="/~dustin/about" onclick="return linkClick(event);">Dustin</a> and this is my personal site for sharing my life.</p></div>
