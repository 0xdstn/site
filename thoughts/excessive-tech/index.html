<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Excessive Tech</h1><p><em>2023.11.27</em></p><p>I recently switched to my own self-hosted <a href="/wiki/nextcloud">Nextcloud</a> instance. I thought a lot about it lately, and have decided to shut it down and seek solutions elsewhere.</p><p>I had set up <a href="/thoughts/nextcloud-music">Nextcloud Music</a> since my <a href="/wiki/ipod/">iPod</a> seems to be having issues (probably the HDD, which I'd like to replace someday so I can use it again). This was fine, but I just didn't feel I was getting the same experience I was getting from the iPod, which I wrote about in my piece <a href="/writing/on-music">On Music</a>. I decided to not use NextCloud for music, but that made me consider something else: do I need such a large and off the shelf solution to solve my problems?</p><p>The answer, as it turns out, is no. I <a href="/writing/digital-minimalism/#Accepting%20technology">decided long ago</a> that I would build solutions for myself if pre-built apps are excessive and/or distracting. NextCloud is great, but it's just so much when my needs are minimal. What I need is this:</p><ul><li>A way to transfer files between devices, usually not many</li><li>A place to store and edit notes</li><li>A way to listen to my music library</li></ul><p>NextCloud seems a bit of an overkill for such simple needs. I've decided to try the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Files:</strong> Using a USB stick to transfer files between devices. I even have a USB-C to USB dongle that I can use to plug it in to my phone</li><li><strong>Notes:</strong> Editing local notes on my phone using <a href="https://github.com/gsantner/markor" target="_blank">Markor</a>, then syncing it to my USB drive each week in case my phone fails</li><li><strong>Music:</strong> This is the difficult one. I was working on a python based GUI to play music on a Raspberry Pi 3 with a touch screen, but that isn't going so well. The app works great, but the touch screen is giving me troubles. I can't seem to calibrate it properly and it's just not great to work with the interface I created. I may try to update the interface to work better with the screen's limitations, but I may also just abandon the project. I also came up with another solution that I am going to try which is plugging a USB stick with all my music into my phone or my computer, whatever I'm using at the time, and listen to it via offline apps. I just got this idea, so I'll try it out and see how it goes. I feel this may give me a similar feeling to using an iPod by requiring me to physically insert the USB stick and selecting the music I want to listen to. I'm also wondering if my car will allow me to just insert a USB stick, as it has some sort of USB media option in the list on the screen. I'll try that out later today and see how that goes too.</li></ul><p>These solutions are simple, and really not all that time consuming, so I feel NextCloud was far more than I ever needed.</p><p><strong>Post 024/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
