<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Here we go!</h1><p><em>2023.09.01</em></p><h2 id="&#128221; 100 Days to Offload"> <span class="emoji">&#128221;</span> 100 Days to Offload</h2><p>This is my first post in the 100 days to offload challenge! I have no idea what I am going to write about, but I'm looking forward to writing more and seeing what others write as well!</p><p>I was inspired to start this because <a href="https://82mhz.net/" target="_blank">82mhz</a> posted that he would be doing it starting September 1, 2023 and asked if others wanted to join. There are a few of us now, which is great!</p><p>You can find a list of participants on <a href="https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/09/100-days-to-offload/" target="_blank">82mhz's first post</a>. There is also an IRC channel set up by <a href="https://box.matto.nl" target="_blank">Matto</a>. The channel is <strong>#phloggersgarage</strong> on <a href="https://libera.chat/" target="_blank">Libera.chat</a>.</p><p>One thing I might do to help myself have something to write about is start doing <a href="https://indieweb.org/week_note" target="_blank">week notes</a> on Sundays, if I have some things to post an update on. I had never heard of this, but just came across it on <a href="https://noisydeadlines.net/week-notes-aug-20-to-aug-27-2023" target="_blank">this post from Noisy Deadlines</a>.</p><h2 id="&#127810; Autumn"> <span class="emoji">&#127810;</span> Autumn</h2><p>I am really looking forward to autumn. It's my favorite season, and cooler weather has already started rolling in. We've had quite a few rainy and cool days. There was even some beautiful fog with a (nearly) full moon last night!</p><p>I'm sitting here in my kitchen with a nice cup of coffee, cool air blowing in from an open window, writing this, and all feels great.  <span class="emoji">&#128153;</span></p><p>I'm trying to slow down. This is something I've tried many times, but I always just end up doing too much again, burning out, and feeling stressed all the time. I want a more relaxed, intentional, and slow paced kind of life. Maybe writing things down here will help with that? I guess we'll see.</p><p><strong>Post 001/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
