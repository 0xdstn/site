<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Just Being</h1><p><em>2024.01.04</em></p><p>I am working on being more mindful and not constantly trying to distract myself from reality. I don't let myself just be, and I'm trying to do that more.</p><p>A couple times in the last few days I muted the radio in the car and just listened to the rain fall outside. Just driving and listening and being. It was nice, and I want to keep doing things like that. I've also managed to sit and enjoy tea or sit with one of my kids without allowing myself to pull out my phone. I always feel like I need to be doing something, but I simply don't.</p><p>There is just so much information and entertainment out there, and we can never consume it all. I don't want to be on social networks scrolling through things that I don't commit to my memory or provide me anything. I don't want to be constantly listening to podcasts, never being able to catch up on the 1000+ episodes I have across all the podcasts I want to listen to, which just keeps growing.</p><p>On the idea of podcast, I'm considering not subscribing to podcasts that post weekly or daily. I notoriously can't keep up with these and then feel I have to when I have a silent moment. I think I will unsubscribe from these:</p><ul><li>Deep Questions with Cal Newport</li><li>The Way Out Is In</li></ul><p>They are great podcasts, but I'm always behind, the episodes are so long, and I just never take the time to sit down to listen to them.</p><p>These I may not give up, but I am considering it. I'm not sure yet:</p><ul><li>The SneakyArt podcast</li><li>BirdNote Daily</li></ul><p>Bidnote is just a few minutes a day, so I think that may be fine, but I often end up not listening for many days and have a ton to get through.</p><p>The SneakyArt podcast is inspiring for making art, so that's a benefit enough to maybe keep it, but I'm choosing to listen to the backlog of episodes, so new ones are always popping up and it will take me a long time to catch up.</p><p>Podcasts aside, I just want to take more moments to just be and enjoy existing.</p><p><strong>Post 034/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
