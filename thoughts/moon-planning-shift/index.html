<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Moon planning shift</h1><p><em>2024.01.10</em></p><p>As mentioned in my <a href="/thoughts/moon-planning">Moon Planning post</a> that I am going to work on planning and reflecting with the cycles of the moon. I have been thinking about it a lot, and I was going to set two focuses each cycle: A learning focus and a personal focus. I have since decided that I don't think that is what I want to do.</p><p>I am currently reading <a href="https://www.yasminboland.com/books/moonology/" target="_blank">Moonology</a> by Yasmin Boland. It is all about planning and making changes in your life with the moon cycles. I'm not too far into it, but it got me thinking about how the best use of my time during these cycles would be to make personal changes. Work on myself to become the best version of me I can be. I will be doing that, and since it's very personal I will not be sharing what my focuses are for each cycle.</p><p>I have decided not to add the learning focus to this. My plan was to focus on learning about the moon for this first cycle (starting tomorrow, January 11th), and I feel that limiting myself to a topic for about a month will likely cause me to lose interest in the topic or find it hard to seek new information about it before the cycle is over. I want to focus on learning whatever feels right at the moment, and not limit myself in this way. I have a lot of interests and I tend to bounce between them in rapid succession, and I don't feel like boxing myself in will promote more learning. I think it will just hinder it.</p><p><strong>Post 036/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
