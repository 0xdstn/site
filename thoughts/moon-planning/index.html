<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Moon Planning</h1><p><em>2024.01.02</em></p><p>I last wrote in my <a href="/thoughts/2024-plans">2024 plans</a> post that I was thinking of focusing on something each quarter (buddhism, witchcraft, etc). I've thought about it since and I have a new plan - set a focus for each moon cycle. This will allow me to switch it up more often (there are 12 full cycles this year). The new moon is a time for planning, and you can harness the moon's energy by setting intentions during a new moon.</p><p>This also opens it up so I have check in points (first quarter, full, and last quarter), where I can assess how I'm doing and make sure I'm staying on track.</p><p>When each new moon comes around I will reflect on the previous cycle, and determine the focus for the next cycle.</p><p>The first full moon is on January 11th, so I am going to spend this time planning exactly how these rituals will look, and determine what I want my first cycle's focus to be.</p><p>In addition to setting a focus and checking in on my progress of it on each moon phase, I am going to try out doing a personal reflection with every phase, to give myself a scheduled time to reflect on how things are going in general and make changes.</p><p>These are the new moons this year:</p><p>01/11, 02/09, 03/10, 04/08, 05/07, 06/06, 07/05, 08/04, 09/02, 10/02, 11/01, 11/30, 12/30</p><p><strong>Post 032/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
