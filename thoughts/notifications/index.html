<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Notifications</h1><p><em>2023.11.14</em></p><p>I have been thinking lately about how to minimize the noise in my life. Not just audible noise, but visual noise as well. In an attempt to achieve this a bit more, I've modified my Android notifications.</p><p>I have minimized the amount of notifications in the past so I only get ones I care about, but that isn't enough. I have now gone through and done the following:</p><ul><li>Turned off notifications for all food delivery apps. I check these periodically when I've ordered anyway, so a notification isn't necessary. This also resulted in no advertisements coming through for them anymore.</li><li>Set notifications for Messages to be silent and not show on the lock screen. I then added special settings for my wife, so that hers come through audibly and visually like they all used to, as she's the only one who's texts are ever important or time sensitive.</li><li>Set all other notifications to be silent and not show on the lock screen. I can see these when I unlock my phone, as they aren't urgent.</li><li>I chose to leave Ring notifications on, as those are time sensitive.</li></ul><p>I'm hoping that this will keep me less bothered throughout the day.</p><p><strong>Post 023/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
