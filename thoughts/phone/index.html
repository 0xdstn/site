<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Phone</h1><p><em>2023.10.03</em></p><p>As with many people, I've struggled a lot with phone addiction. I have been working on actively changing that.</p><p>My main change is how I view my phone: <strong>as a tool</strong>.</p><p>I do not keep entertainment apps on my phone. This specifically means I don't have <strong>social apps</strong> (mastodon, instagram, etc) or <strong>games</strong> (only exception is the NYT games app). These are my biggest time sucks on my phone. I don't want to turn on my phone to mindlessly do things for the sake of doing things.</p><p>I want to only pick up my phone for a <em>purpose</em>. This is why I am not including streaming apps as "entertainment". When I want to watch something, I use my phone as the tool for that. I also don't really watch much to begin with, so this may be less of an issue for me than others.</p><p>If I want to use Mastodon, Instagram, or play a game, I will do so with intentionality on a device I don't carry around with me - my computer. This is how it used to be before we all had a tiny computer in our pockets. Everything was a lot simpler, and a lot more intentional, not necessarily because we chose to, but because that was the nature of technology at the time. I miss that. While everyone else will still be in the ever-connected future, I can bring myself back to that time with changes like this.</p><p><strong>Post 010/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
