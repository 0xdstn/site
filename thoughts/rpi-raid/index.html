<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Raspberry Pi RAID</h1><p><em>2023.10.30</em></p><p>I recently decided to <a href="/thoughts/nextcloud-music">move to Nextcloud Music</a>, which was all great and well, however my Raspberry Pi that I am running Nextcloud on didn't have enough space to store my music library. It is 41.5 GB and the Raspberry Pi has a 32 GB SD card.</p><p>Per a conversation on Mastodon, <a href="https://82mhz.net" target="_blank">82mhz</a> explained his RAID 1 setup with 2 USB drives on a Raspberry Pi. He wrote up a <a href="https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/10/using-two-usb-sticks-as-a-raid-on-a-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank">post explaining how he did this</a>, which I used to set up the same thing on mine. It was simple and I had no issues! Thanks 82mhz for writing that up!</p><p>I then needed to move my Nextcloud files to a new location, so it would store on the RAID. Nextcloud doesn't officially support doing this, and the <a href="https://help.nextcloud.com/t/howto-change-move-data-directory-after-installation/17170" target="_blank">process for doing so</a> seems overly complicated. I found it easier to just backup my data and re-install Nextcloud with the new location. This worked and I now have my nextcloud storing to the RAID using 2 USB sticks. This should ensure that if one goes down, or even the SD card fails, I should have a copy of my data that I can restore from when setting up new hardware.</p><p>It's been a process, but I'm glad I went down this path of hosting my own things. I feel much more in control of my data and it's not stored/owned by some corporation.</p><p><strong>Post 016/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
