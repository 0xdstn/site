<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Self hosting</h1><p><em>2023.08.29</em></p><p>I'm considering buying a domain and self hosting my site. I'd just run it on a <strong>Raspbery Pi 3 Model B+</strong>. I've done this before, so I know what needs to happen to set it up.</p><p>I'd then also consider hosting the following:</p><ul><li>A gemini site</li><li>A gopher site</li><li>A Tor site</li></ul><p>I love tilde.town, but I think there is also something enjoyable about managing my own hosting.</p><p>I am curious how that would affect people who currently follow me via RSS, or have my website bookmarked/linked to from their site.</p><p>I imagine I could replace page contents with a message that says "This page has been moved to x" with a link to the same page on my new site, and put in a javascript redirect as well so it can redirect automatically.</p><p>I'd then likely post to my blog on the old site saying the site has moved with the new URL, which would also get picked up in people's RSS feeds so they can know to update their entry for my site.</p><p>If you follow me or have bookmarks/links to my site, I'd love to hear your opinion on a switch like this. Feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:0xdstn@protonmail.com">email</a>.</p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey! Thanks for reading!
