<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Sketch Memory</h1><p><em>2023.11.06</em></p><p>This thought came to me while reading <a href="http://flower.codes/2023/11/03/happy-halloween.html" target="_blank">Zach's halloween post</a>. In it, he talked about using an old camcorder to record memories this Halloween, and how the process of recording it, transferring it, and editing it provided a much more enjoyable experience as opposed to recording on a phone and sending it out to people instantly.</p><p>This got me thinking about why I sketch journal. I don't normally share the pages of my sketch journal online, but they are anything and everything I want to document from my life, be it a family trip, just a normal weekend activity, or something around me that shows daily life. The act of illustrating does a couple of things for me that simply taking a photo does not:</p><ol><li>It cements the moment in my memory in a way that a photo does not. I tend to remember every day that I've drawn, and I don't usually remember the ones I don't</li><li>I occasionally look through my sketchbooks and relive the things I drew. I rarely revisit old photos on my phone.</li></ol><p>Keeping a sketch journal is as much a memory tool as it is an enjoyable hobby for me. I'm documenting my life and enjoying the process. If you are at all artistic, I would highly recommend giving this a go to see if it has similar effects for you. Even if you aren't artistic, maybe still give it a try! The "quality" of the art does not matter, what matters is capturing the feeling and/or the memory.</p><p><strong>Post 018/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
