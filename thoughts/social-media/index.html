      <div id="content"><h2>Social Media</h2><p><em>August 13th, 2019</em></p><p>Over the last year or so, I've noticed a pattern with myself, related to my social media usage.</p><p>When I say social media, I'm mostly referring to Twitter and Mastodon. I actually don't seem to have much of a problem with Instagram or Facebook.</p><p>I tend to get addicted to microblogging services. This causes me to be constantly absorbed in my phone, ignoring everyone and everything around me. I find it hard to go a few minutes without checking if I'm not busy doing something else that requires my attention.</p><p>I also tend to seek validation through likes. This is an obsession a lot of us have, and I don't feel it's very healthy behavior. When I was young I would create things for myself, for fun. Now it seems I am only in it for the validation. When I allow myself to just create and enjoy the fact that I made something, it's much more fulfilling.</p><p>When I post on these platforms, I often feel as though I'm shouting into the void. This is particularly bad on Twitter. When I post, is anyone <em>really</em> reading it? If I don't get a lot of feedback, it feels like it was for no reason and silly to even post it.</p><p>I've thought a lot about the audience I'm trying to reach with accounts like these, and I don't really have one. I don't need anyone to see anything I would post on there. It doesn't improve my quality of life. I am much better off hanging out in little places on the internet such as <a href="http://tilde.town" target="_blank">tilde.town</a> and using the chat and <a href="/~dustin/projects/tilde-social" onclick="return linkClick(event);">Tilde Social</a> functionality to connect with others.</p><p>I'm going to do my best to stay away from large social media platforms from now on. It keeps my head clear and keeps me present, and that's what I really need.</p></div>
