<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Syncretism</h1><p><em>2023.10.23</em></p><p>A while back I was thinking about how I just take relevant pieces of various belief systems, and looked if there was a word for that, and there is!</p><blockquote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism" target="_blank">Syncretism</a> is the practice of combining different beliefs and various schools of thought.</blockquote><p>And specifically, religious syncretism:</p><blockquote>Religious syncretism is the blending of two or more religious belief systems into a new system, or the incorporation into a religious tradition of beliefs from unrelated traditions.</blockquote><p>Most of what I believe and try to live my life by is pulled from either Buddhism, Paganism, or Stoicism. I've blended everything together to form what I believe and to create a system for how I want to live my life. This is why I don't call myself a Buddhist, Pagan/witch, etc. I have not really adopted any singular system as it is, so it doesn't feel appropriate to use the descriptive terms for those who practice each system as a whole.</p><p>I normally view things from a secular lens, so I tend to leave more spiritual elements out of what I do. I don't hold the Buddhist belief of rebirth, or call upon goddesses/gods from various Pagan beliefs.</p><p>I do, however, pull things out such as The <a href="/wiki/buddhism/#The Eightfold Path">Eightfold Path</a> from Buddhism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori" target="_blank">Momento Mori</a> from Stoicism, connecting with nature from Paganism, etc. There is even a lot of overlap with the places I pull my beliefs from, such as carrying yourself with calmness and kindness, being mindful of the earth and caring for it's creatures, self reflection and self awareness, etc.</p><p>I doubt I will ever fully adopt a religion or belief system as it is, so I suppose the correct term to call myself would be a syncretist? Maybe I'll just continue saying I'm me and I believe what I believe, wherever it comes from.</p><p><strong>Post 015/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
