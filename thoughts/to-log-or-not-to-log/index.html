      <div id="content"><h2>To log or not to log</h2><p><em>July 19th, 2019</em></p><p>I have spent a lot of time attempting to digitally log various things over the years. Majority of this has been health related - steps, calories, water consumption, walks/runs, meditation, etc.</p><p>I started looking into tracking other things, such as how I spend my time. I tried doing this for just a single day, and it felt very daunting on top of all of the other things I have going on in my life.</p><p>While I feel these kind of statistics can be useful, I needed to take a step back and look at how I would be using them. In the end, I decided I was trying to log for the sake of logging, since other people are doing it, and didn't have any real reason to be doing so, or any plan to utilize the data.</p><p>This was a good realization for me. I have been tracking many things, and I feel as though it's just a time consuming task for me, and I will never use the data.</p><p>Two of the things I am going to stop tracking is water and food. If I'm being mindful of how/what I'm eating, and whether or not I've had enough water in the day, the numbers don't really matter. I can tell when I'm eating poorly, or if I'm trying to eat more than I should. I can also tell if I haven't had enough water and should drink more. These ones specifically are really a challenge to be mindful about what I put into my body.</p><p>The only things I have any plans of tracking is sleep and running. I can actually use this information for something. If I am sleeping poorly, I can try to figure out what exactly is the cause, and try to remediate it. As for running, I enjoy this and would like to increase my speed/distance, so this is something I am going to be tracking and working on.</p><p>I want to work with technology to make my life simple and mindful, not complicate it for no reason.</p><p>I understand that tracking data like this is helpful for others, but it just isn't useful for me, personally.</p></div>
