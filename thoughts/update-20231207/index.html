<a href="/thoughts">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128173;</span> Update 2023-12-07</h1><p><em>2023.12.07</em></p><h2 id="100 Days to Offload">100 Days to Offload</h2><p>I'm definitely behind a bit. Time off for Thanksgiving is a large part of the reason. I didn't get any posts written that week I believe, and only one last week. Actually, I think I was a week or so ahead, and 2 a week would be more than 100 posts, so maybe I'm just back on track as opposed to ahead. I don't feel like mathing out where I should be. I'm just going to try to get more posts done so I don't actually fall behind or fall behind further.</p><h2 id="Mastodon">Mastodon</h2><p>I've just not been feeling Mastodon lately. I think I may just take some time off from it. I don't think I'll even post this there. It just often feels like it doesn't provide a ton given the time I put in to reading every post in my feed. I much prefer emails. Feel free to send me one if you'd like! <a href="mailto:0xdstn@protonmail.com">0xdstn@protonmail.com</a></p><h2 id="Advent of Code">Advent of Code</h2><p>Still going on this! I skipped day 5 part 2, because it was incredibly difficult and I don't care enough to put more time into that. I did however finish 6, so all I have left that is available at the time of writing this is today's, day 7. I hear it's difficult, so we'll see if I get it done. I may be getting close to my limit for this year, but I'll stick it out as long as it stays fun.</p><h2 id="Toki Pona">Toki Pona</h2><p>I've decided to start attempting to learn toki pona again. I am trying out Anki this time. It seems to be going well actually, I think I've learned a couple new words and gotten more confident on the ones that were less automatic for me. I already know most toki pona words, but I have some that are really difficult to get to stick for some reason. Hoping this will result in me knowing all of them. I then will work on reading things such as <a href="https://liputenpo.org/" target="_blank">lipu tenpo</a>. I'd also like to write more in toki pona, either in my journal or on here. I did write a haiku the other day:</p><blockquote>telo sewi o<br>telo mute lon ale<br>kasi li pona</blockquote><p>This roughly translates to:</p><blockquote>rain!<br>a lot of water is on everything<br>the plant is happy</blockquote><p><strong>Post 026/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
