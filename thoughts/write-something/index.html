      <div id="content"><h2>Write something</h2><p><em>June 16th, 2018</em></p><p>I was listening to a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6ziVCJnEm59" target="_blank">playlist on Spotify</a> the other day, and Bees by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/21vNMGKtXBA2a8PaVdIgrM" target="_blank">The Ballroom Thieves</a> came on. This song contains a quote from Benjamin Franklin, which resonated with me:</p><blockquote>Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.</blockquote><p>I've considered setting up a blog many times, but have never pulled the trigger. Maybe I just felt I didn't have anything worthwhile to write. Maybe the daunting task of creating a design got in the way. Maybe I was afraid of what others would think about what I wrote, or maybe that nobody would read it.</p><p>None of these are good reasons not to write. While I don't have much experience writing, it is something I am interested in.</p><p>The above quote inspired me to get this blog set up. I may not be able to do much worth writing about, but I can write something worth reading, or at least I will try.</p></div>
