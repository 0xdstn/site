<a href="/~dustin/wiki">..</a><h1 id="Buddhism">Buddhism</h1><p>These are my notes from studying and practicing <strong>secular Buddhism</strong>.

There is no way around it.</p><h3 id="Truth of Cause of Suffering">Truth of Cause of Suffering</h3><p>The main cause of suffering is habitual reactivity.</p><p>Suffering emerges when we want life to be different than it is.</p><p>Our reaction causes the suffering, not the thing itself.</p><h3 id="Truth of the End of Suffering">Truth of the End of Suffering</h3><p>The cessation of suffering.</p><p>The suffering doesn't cease, but rather our craving not to suffer does.</p><h3 id="Truth of the Path That Leads to the End of Suffering">Truth of the Path That Leads to the End of Suffering</h3><p>The Eightfold Path.</p><p>The path of liberation.</p><p>The path to the cessation of suffering.</p><h2 id="The Eightfold Path">The Eightfold Path</h2><p>Ways to live that lead to the end of suffering.</p><p>There are three sections that the various points of the Eightfold Path are grouped under:</p><ul><li>1-2 <strong>Wisdom</strong> (understanding, intent)</li><li>3-5 <strong>Ethical Conduct</strong> (speech, action, livelihood)</li><li>6-8 <strong>Mental Discipline</strong> (effort, mindfulness, concentration)</li></ul><ol><li><a href="#Right Understanding">Right

Livelihood">Right Livelihood</a></li><li><a href="#Right Effort">Right Effort</a></li><li><a href="#Right Mindfulness">Right Mindfulness</a></li><li><a href="#Right Concentration">Right Concentration</a></li></ol><h3 id="Right Understanding">Right Understanding</h3><p>What we are seeing might not actually be what it appears to be.</p><p>Uncertain concepts and ideas that prevent us from seeing reality as it is.</p><h3 id="Right Intent">Right Intent</h3><p>Be aware of our intentions regarding the things we say and do.</p><p>Intentions from anger or hatred are more likely to cause harm than intentions from happiness and gratitude.</p><p>Behaving reactively makes it difficult to be mindful of our intentions.</p><h3 id="Right Speech">Right Speech</h3><p>Communicating with others in a way that doesn't cause harm.</p><p>Lying, gossiping, or insulting are not right speech.</p><p>With right speech, you consider why you say something as much as what you say.</p><h3 id="Right Action">Right Action</h3><p>Doing what is proper and necessary for your situation.</p><p>While this sometimes includes "doing the right thing" morally, it more closely resembles behaving appropriately in any situation.</p><h3 id="Right Livelihood">Right Livelihood</h3><p>Livelihood is how we make a living and how we interact with others on the job.</p><p>We need to determine if what we do is doing more harm or good for ourselves and others.</p><h3 id="Right Effort">Right Effort</h3><p>What it takes to put into practice the other parts of the path.</p><p>It takes effort if we want any kind of positive change in our lives.</p><h3 id="Right Mindfulness">Right Mindfulness</h3><p>Paying attention at all times.</p><p>Being mindful helps us stay anchored in the present moment, which keeps us in touch with reality as it is.</p><h3 id="Right Concentration">Right Concentration</h3><p>The practice of focusing on only one thing, whatever it is we are doing.</p><p>The opposite is distraction.</p><h2 id="The Five Aggregates">The Five Aggregates</h2><p>Suffering arises when one identifies with or clings to one of the aggregates.</p><ol><li><a href="#Form or Materiality">Form or

Formation or Thought Process</a></li><li><a href="#Consciousness or Awareness">Consciousness or Awareness</a></li></ol><h3 id="Form or Materiality">Form or Materiality</h3><p>Something material that can be sensed with sight, sound, taste or touch.</p><h3 id="Sensation or Feeling Tone">Sensation or Feeling Tone</h3><p>The feeling state that arises when we sense something pleasant or unpleasant.</p><p>Feeling tones can be understood as pleasure, pain, or neutrality.</p><h3 id="Perception">Perception</h3><p>Recognition of a sensation we have experienced.</p><p>Perception is giving names to something, like "scary".</p><h3 id="Mental Formation or Thought Process">Mental Formation or Thought Process</h3><p>Likes, dislikes, biases, and prejudices.</p><p>Mental formations alter perception.</p><h3 id="Consciousness or Awareness">Consciousness or Awareness</h3><p>General awareness of other aggregates that make the entire experience possible.</p><h2 id="The Five Precepts">The Five Precepts</h2><p>There are no moral absolutes in Buddhism, so the precepts are left to interpretation.</p><p>These are general rules of things that are best to abstain from.</p><ol><li><a

Mind">Abstain From Intoxicants That Cloud The Mind</a></li></ol><h3 id="Abstain From Taking Life">Abstain From Taking Life</h3><p>Could relate to abortion, death penalty, or killing insects.</p><p>In order to weigh consequences of our actions, it's helpful to examine if it's motivated by greed, hatred, and delusion, or by kindness, wisdom, and compassion.</p><p>Intent plays a key role.</p><h3 id="Abstain From Taking What is Not Given">Abstain From Taking What is Not Given</h3><p>Goes beyond stealing and includes evaluating your motivations and understanding how your actions will affect others.</p><h3 id="Abstain From Sexual Misconduct">Abstain From Sexual Misconduct</h3><p>What is considered misconduct is determined by the inherited culture and societal views.</p><p>Non-consensual sex and sexual exploitation are misconduct.</p><p>Examine how your actions make you feel and how it will impact others.</p><h3 id="Abstain From Incorrect Speech">Abstain From Incorrect Speech</h3><p>Goes beyond not telling lies.</p><p>It means speaking honestly and communicating in a way that is beneficial to others.</p><p>Incorrect speech is rooted in the three poisons of greed, hatred, and ignorance.</p><p>Misleading others, saying intentionally hurtful things, and gossiping are incorrect speech.</p><h3 id="Abstain From Intoxicants That Cloud The Mind">Abstain From Intoxicants That Cloud The Mind</h3><p>Could be alcohol, drugs, or anything that clouds the mind, or alters perception.</p><p>Media we consume or addictive habits.</p><p>Be cautious of distractions from reality.</p><h2 id="The Three Marks of Existence">The Three Marks of Existence</h2><ol><li><a href="#Suffering">Suffering</a></li><li><a href="#Impermanence">Impermanence</a></li><li><a href="#Non-self">Non-self</a></li></ol><h3 id="Suffering">Suffering</h3><p>There are 3 types of suffering</p><ol><li><strong>Suffering of Suffering</strong><br> Natural suffering like pain.</li><li><strong>Suffering of Loss</strong><br> Lose a job, a loved one, our youth. Circumstantial.</li><li><strong>All-pervasive Suffering</strong><br> Self-inflicted. Arises out of an ignorant or delusional understanding of reality. Has to do with how we perceive and interpret circumstances. We self-inflict based on a belief or concept. If we didn't hold the false belief, the suffering wouldn't exist.</li></ol><h3 id="Impermanence">Impermanence</h3><p>All things are constantly changing. Jobs, relationships, thoughts, feelings, loved ones, ourselves, everything we know and perceive will pass out of existence.</p><p>We know this, but we cling to things and perceive them as permanent.</p><p>Two types of impermanence - gross and subtle.</p><ol><li><strong>Gross</strong><br> Matter decays, empires rise and fall, societal norms change and evolve.</li><li><strong>Subtle</strong><br> Moment-to-moment, cells in your body die and regenerate, you are never exactly the same. We are collections of impermanent, momentary experiences.</li></ol><p>Loss is a natural part of life, not something we need to fight against.</p><h3 id="Non-self">Non-self</h3><p>You are not what you think you are, because there is no inherent essence in anything.</p><p>Things are because of, and in relation to, other things, but do not exist on their own as permanent or separate entities.</p><p>Everything has causes and conditions, nothing stands alone.</p><p>There is no permanent or fixed you, just a complex web of inseparable, impermanent, causes and effects.</p><h2 id="The Three Poisons">The Three Poisons</h2><ol><li>Greed</li><li>Hatred</li><li>Ignorance</li></ol>		</article>
