<a href="/wiki/witchcraft">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128216;</span> Power Animal Meditation</h1><p>I don't remember where I found the instructions for this meditation, but the idea is you sit in a meditation position, close your eyes, take some deep breaths, and envision yourself walking through a tunnel. As you go through the tunnel you drop your fears and concerns. When you exit the tunnel you will be somewhere and that is where you will meet  your power animal.</p><p>The result of this was nothing like what I expected, which made it feel even more profound.</p><p><strong>Here was my experience:</strong></p><p>I entered the dark cave with thoughts of what I expected to find. After being engulfed in complete darkness, the walls suddenly lit up, emitting a soft blue glow. Along with ornate lines, I found a reflection of my expectations etched into the wall. A crow, a squirrel, and a hummingbird. It is as if my thoughts were absorbed by the wall, now it's to keep.</p><p>I exited the tunnel into a stunning view of a forest. The trees were thick and you could see a beautiful mountain far away, covered in fog. Right at the edge of the trees was an opening into a clearing. It was shaded and cool with fallen trees and moss everywhere. A stream was flowing to the right.</p><p>I looked around expectantly, glancing up to see if there were any crows. Everything was silent and I was completely alone. I decided to sit on a log and wait.</p><p>Not long after I sat and cleared my mind, I saw movement. Fish were jumping out of the stream. I glanced over and found a large grizzly bear catching fish.</p><p>I walked over and asked the bear if it was my power animal. It looked at me curiously, silent. It moved closer and sat facing me in a meditation pose and gestured for me to do the same. I sat and we both closed our eyes. The bear morphed into a wispy light which shot over and entered my body, becoming part of me. With the power of my animal awoken, I got up and exited back through the tunnel.</p><p><strong>Post 021/100 of <a href="/thoughts/100-days-to-offload">#100DaysToOffload</a></strong></p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
