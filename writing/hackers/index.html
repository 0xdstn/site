<a href="/~dustin/writing">..</a><h1 id="Hackers">Hackers</h1><p><em>2022.07.19</em></p><p>I have always viewed the title "hacker" to require a certain level of skill to claim. I'm realizing that this view is simply wrong. Being a hacker has nothing to do with skills. It has to do with having the hacker mindset.</p><p>Not accepting things (systems, technology, etc) as they are, but instead view them as something to be tinkered with and modified. To take things, figure out their limits, and push them. To turn something into what you need, not just take what you're given as is.</p><p>I have always had this  hacker mindset. Since I was young I've taken things apart to figure out how they work and put them back together. I've always taken technology, and pushed their limits to best suit my needs.</p><p>You don't have to know how to break into computer systems or any other specific skill like that. You just have to be curious, never accept things as they are, and never stop learning.</p><p><strong>I am a hacker.</strong></p>		</article>
