<a href="/writing">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128221;</span> Identity</h1><p><em>2023.03.08</em></p><p>Something a lot of people do is take their interests or their skills and define themselves with it:</p><blockquote>I am a software engineer<br>I am an artist<br>I am a writer<br>I am a hacker<br>I am a musician<br>etc</blockquote><p>I don't feel like I'm disciplined enough in any of my many interests to call myself by it's title. I've tried over and over to make an interest my identity. I go through moods where I think I need to set up an instagram and build up fame as an artist or create a pseudonym and learn to be a bug bounty hunter or start making chiptune music, along with many other interests. This never works out, burns me out, and I get nowhere.</p><p><em>Rinse and repeat.</em></p><p>Usually when I dive into one of these interests, I spend more time trying to define the identity as opposed to actually creating something.</p><p>Instead of defining my identity with one of these things, I'm instead going to define myself like this:</p><p><strong>I am me. I am curious.</strong></p><p>I don't need to redefine myself and set up these new identities. I already have an identity, and it's me and my curiousity. I've always been incredibly curious about a wide array of things. Curiosity has been the one consistent thing.</p><p>I will no longer allow this cycle to happen, and instead simply follow my curiosity and share the results here. This will allow me to focus evenly on everything I'm interested in, spend time on something when I'm motivated for that particular interest, and not burn myself out obsessing over creating new identites.</p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey!
