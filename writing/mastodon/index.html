<a href="/writing">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128221;</span> Returning to Mastodon</h1><p><em>2022.11.29</em></p><p>A while back I decided to limit the amount of social media I was using, including Mastodon. I didn't like the way it made me feel and the way it distracted me from everything else in my life.</p><p>I have recently made the decision to get back on Mastodon in a small local community with people I know IRL. As per my personal philosophy on technology, I am going to be mindful of my usage, which will include:</p><ul><li>Not having it installed on my phone, so I can intentionally open up my laptop to go check my feed</li><li>Being mindful of who I'm following to minimize unnecessary feed bloat</li><li>Staying out of the global feed as it's a huge time suck</li><li>Being on a small instance with people I know to get the most out of the local feed</li></ul><p>Since leaving Mastodon, I used <a href="/projects/mastofeed">mastofeed</a> and <a href="/writing/rss">RSS</a> to follow people who's work and thoughts I care to keep up on, however I often wanted to comment on the posts but had no way to, so I will be happy to be able to do that again.</p><p>I will mostly be posting updates to my website and projects I'm working on.</p><p>If you want to follow me I'm at <a href="https://mastodon.spotek.io/@dustin" target="_blank">@dustin@mastodon.spotek.io</a></p><p>I am also on <a href="https://toki.social/@0xdstn" target="_blank">toki.social</a>, to immerse myself in toki pona for learning purposes.</p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey! Thanks for reading! If you have any comments or questions about this post, or anything else, I'd love to chat!
