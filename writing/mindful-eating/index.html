<a href="/~dustin/writing">..</a><h1 id="Mindful Eating">Mindful Eating</h1><p><em>2022.09.07</em></p><p>Mindful eating is something that has been challenging for me, but I find a lot of benefits in it.</p><p>I realized that I tend to queue up a new bite while still chewing the last one. This feels like I am just trying to consume all the food as fast as possible, not paying attention to the bite I'm eating. My solution to this is to take a bite, then set down my fork until it's gone and I'm ready to take another bite. Doing this allows me to fully experience and enjoy the food, be aware of how full I am, and be more present in the moment, as opposed to passively eating. At the end of my meal, I also don't clear the dishes until I've finished my final bite.</p><p>Like a lot of people, I tend to read or use my phone while eating. This causes me to be unaware of the food that I am eating, and not something I want, so I no longer allow myself to have any sort of media during meals. I want to only consume food, not external things. This helps me be present and focused.</p><p>When eating alone, I treat it like a meditation. I don't want to spend the time thinking about other things. Instead I choose to focus on the flavors, textures, and smells of the food. I also take some of the time thinking about being grateful for the food and where it came from. I think about where it came from or the person that prepared it. I think about the plants, animals, and/or people involved in producing the ingredients, and thank them for their had work or sacrifice so that I can be nourished.</p>		</article>
