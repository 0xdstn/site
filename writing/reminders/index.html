<h1 id="Reminders">Reminders</h1><p><em>2021.10.15</em></p><p>I have written on this website about various personal struggles I've had with staying <a href="/~dustin/writing/focus">focused</a> and <a href="/~dustin/writing/social">social media</a>. The things documented in those articles are recurring issues I can't seem to completely get away from. They always come back.</p><p>There is one thing that is different now - I have my written thoughts on the matters, when I was in a much better headspace, available to read when I am struggling. This has been hugely beneficial, and I'm glad I have it, and that I am thinking of re-reading them whenever things start to go south.</p><p>It has prevented me from going down rabbit holes I know will just exhaust me, and going and setting up new identities online. It's like having past me travel to the future and remind me not to mess things up, and I appreciate that I provided this for myself.</p><p>I'm going to keep doing these things, and I'm going to write them here again as a reminder:</p><ul><li>Focus on reading and painting as hobbies</li><li>Stay away from social media as much as possible</li><li>Be intentional with your use of technology</li><li>Don't get caught up in the many enticing rabbit holes</li><li>You've got this :)</li></ul>		</article>
