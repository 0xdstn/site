<a href="/writing">..</a><h1><span class="emoji">&#128221;</span> Social Media Withdrawal</h1><p><em>2021.04.15</em></p><p>I'm already feeling social media withdrawal. It's only been a couple weeks, if that. I'm used to scrolling through Instagram and Mastodon.</p><p>It feels like I'm missing out. That I could be interacting with like-minded people and I'm not.</p><p>The silly thing is I normally don't really interact with people on social media, I just browse, giving me that hit of dopamine my body is craving.</p><p>Instead of going and making an account somewhere, I'm writing here. Maybe nobody will read this, maybe someone will, who knows. This is more for me.</p><p>I want to spend time writing, thinking, and creating, not scrolling mindlessly.</p><p>I often feel like I'm missing out on information. There are <em>things</em> out there being created that I'm not seeing. The truth is I hardly see anything that I couldn't have lived without.</p><p>I will probably go read some things from my RSS feeds. That should help. This seems to have helped too.</p><blockquote class="thanks"> <span class="emoji">&#128075;</span> Hey! Thanks for reading!
